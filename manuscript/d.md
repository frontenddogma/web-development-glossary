D3.js
: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. D3.js makes use of the widely implemented Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), HTML, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standards. It is the successor to the earlier Protovis framework. In contrast to many other libraries, D3.js allows great control over the final visual result. D3.js was first released in 2011.&nbsp;[†](#w-d3js) ℹ︎&nbsp;[d3js.org](https://d3js.org/)

Daemon
: A computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally, the process names of a daemon end with the letter “d”, for clarification that the process is in fact a daemon, and for differentiation between a daemon and a normal computer program. For example, syslogd is the daemon that implements the system logging facility, and sshd is a daemon that serves incoming SSH connections.&nbsp;[†](#w-daemon)

Daily Active Users
: → Active Users

Daily Scrum
: A daily Scrum event, time-boxed to 15 minutes, in which a Scrum Development Team plans the next development day. A Daily Scrum is not necessarily a “stand-up.”

Dark Mode
: A color scheme that uses light-colored text, icons, and graphical user interface elements on a dark background and is often discussed in terms of computer user interface design and web design. Light on dark color schemes require less energy to display on the most common display technologies.&nbsp;[†](#w-dark-mode)

Dark pattern
: A user interface that has been crafted to trick users into doing things. The neologism “dark pattern” was coined in 2010 by Harry Brignull. Another more broad definition of a dark pattern is an instance where “user value is supplanted in favor of shareholder value.”&nbsp;[†](#w-dark-pattern) ℹ︎&nbsp;[darkpatterns.org](https://www.darkpatterns.org/)

Darknet
: The part of the Internet below the private Deep Web that uses custom software and hidden networks superimposed on the architecture of the Internet. “Darknet” was originally often associated with the Tor network. Anonymous communication between whistle-blowers, journalists, and news organisations is also facilitated by the “Darknet” Tor network.&nbsp;[†](#w-darknet)

Dart
: A client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms. Dart is used to build mobile, desktop, backend, and web applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class defined, garbage-collected language using a C-style syntax that transcompiles optionally into JavaScript. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics, static typing, and a sound type system. Dart was released in 2011 by Google.&nbsp;[†](#w-dart) ℹ︎&nbsp;[dart.dev](https://dart.dev/)

Data
: Individual units of information. A datum describes a single quality or quantity of some object or phenomenon. In analytical processes, data are represented by variables. Data is sometimes said to be transformed into information when it is viewed in context or in post-analysis.&nbsp;[†](#w-data)

Data Control Language
: A syntax similar to a computer programming language used to control access to data stored in a database (authorization). In particular, it is a component of Structured Query Language (SQL).&nbsp;[†](#w-dcl)

Data Definition Language
: A syntax similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures, especially database schemas. DDL statements create and modify database objects such as tables, indexes, and users. Common DDL statements are `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`.&nbsp;[†](#w-ddl)

Data Manipulation Language
: A computer programming language used for adding (inserting), deleting, and modifying (updating) data in a database. A DML is often a sublanguage of a broader database language such as SQL, with the DML comprising some of the operators in the language. Read-only selecting of data is sometimes distinguished as being part of a separate data query language (DQL), but it is closely related and sometimes also considered a component of a DML; some operators may perform both selecting (reading) and writing.&nbsp;[†](#w-dml)

Data Query Language
: → Query language

Data Stream Management System
: A computer software system to manage continuous data streams. A DSMS is similar to a database management system (DBMS), which is, however, designed for static data in conventional databases. A DSMS also offers a flexible query processing so that the information need can be expressed using queries. However, in contrast to a DBMS, a DSMS executes a continuous query that is not only performed once, but is permanently installed. Therefore, the query is continuously executed until it is explicitly uninstalled.&nbsp;[†](#w-dsms)

Data type
: → Type

Data visualization
: The graphic representation of data. Data visualization involves producing images that communicate relationships among the represented data to viewers of the images. This communication is achieved through the use of a systematic mapping between graphic marks and data values in the creation of the visualization. This mapping establishes how data values will be represented visually, determining how and to what extent a property of a graphic mark, such as size or color, will change to reflect change in the value of a datum. To communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses statistical graphics, plots, information graphics, and other tools. Numerical data may be encoded using dots, lines, or bars, to visually communicate a quantitative message. Effective visualization helps users analyze and reason about data and evidence. It makes complex data more accessible, understandable, and usable.&nbsp;[†](#w-data-visualization)

Database
: An organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Relational databases model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. Non-relational databases, also referred to as NoSQL, use different query languages.&nbsp;[†](#w-database)

Database index
: A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure. Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered records.&nbsp;[†](#w-database-index)

Database language
: → Query language

Database Management System
: A “software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database.” The DBMS acronym is sometime extended to indicated the underlying database model, with RDBMS for relational, OODBMS or ORDBMS for the object (orientated) model and ORDBMS for Object-Relational. Other extensions can indicate some other characteristic, such as DDBMS for a distributed database management systems.&nbsp;[†](#w-database)

: Distributed → Denial of Service

Dead code elimination
: A compiler optimization to remove code which does not affect the program results. Removing such code has several benefits: it shrinks program size, an important consideration in some contexts, and it allows the running program to avoid executing irrelevant operations, which reduces its running time. It can also enable further optimizations by simplifying program structure. Dead code includes code that can never be executed (unreachable code), and code that only affects dead variables (written to, but never read again), that is, irrelevant to the program.&nbsp;[†](#w-dce)

Debugging
: The process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling.&nbsp;[†](#w-debugging)

Declaration
: In CSS, a declaration assigns a value of a property (or, in case of a shorthand, several values for several properties) to a selected element. A declaration is part of a declaration block as well as a rule. It consists of a property, a colon (`:`), and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon (`;`) must be inserted to separate each declaration.&nbsp;[†](#w-css)

Declaration block
: A block of zero or more CSS declarations and at-rules, enclosed by an opening (`{`) and a closing curly brace (`}`).

Decoration
: The attempt to make a physical or visual object more beautiful. Not to be confused with Design.

Decryption
: The opposite of encryption, or the reverse process of it, moving from unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext.&nbsp;[†](#w-cryptography)

Deep Web
: Parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not indexed by standard web search-engines. The opposite term to the deep web is the “Surface Web,” which is accessible to everyone using the Internet. Computer-scientist Michael K. Bergman is credited with coining the term “deep web” in 2001 as a search-indexing term. The content of the Deep Web is hidden behind HTTP forms and includes many very common uses such as web mail, online banking, private or otherwise restricted access social-media pages and profiles, some web forums that require registration for viewing content, and services that users must pay for, and which are protected by paywalls, such as video on demand and some online magazines and newspapers.&nbsp;[†](#w-deep-web)

Definition of Done
: A Scrum term that means a shared understanding of expectations that an increment must meet in order to be potentially releasable. Mutually defined by the Development Teams of an organization’s Scrum teams.

Demilitarized Zone
: A physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization’s external-facing services to an untrusted network, usually a larger network such as the Internet. The purpose of a DMZ is to add an additional layer of security to an organization’s local area network (LAN): An external network node can access only what is exposed in the DMZ, while the rest of the organization’s network is firewalled.&nbsp;[†](#w-dmz)

Denial of Service
: A cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.&nbsp;[†](#w-dos)

Deno
: A runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language. It was created in 2018 by Ryan Dahl, original creator of Node.js, and is focused on security and productivity. Deno explicitly takes on the role of both runtime and package manager within a single executable, rather than requiring a separate package-management program.&nbsp;[†](#w-deno) ℹ︎&nbsp;[deno.land](https://deno.land/)

Dependency
: → Coupling

Dependency injection
: A technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object. A “dependency” is an object that can be used, for example as a service. Instead of a client specifying which service it will use, something tells the client what service to use. The “injection” refers to the passing of a dependency (a service) into the object (a client) that would use it. The service is made part of the client’s state. Passing the service to the client, rather than allowing a client to build or find the service, is the fundamental requirement of the pattern. The intent behind dependency injection is to achieve Separation of Concerns of construction and use of objects. This can increase readability and code reuse.&nbsp;[†](#w-dependency-injection)

Deployment
: All of the activities that make a software system available for use. The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. Because every software system is unique, the precise processes or procedures within each activity are difficult to define. Therefore, “deployment” should be interpreted as a general process that has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics.&nbsp;[†](#w-deployment)

Deprecated
: → Deprecation

Deprecation
: The discouragement of use of some terminology, feature, design, or practice, typically because it has been superseded or is no longer considered efficient or safe, without completely removing it or prohibiting its use.&nbsp;[†](#w-deprecation)

Design
: A plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product, or process. The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment.&nbsp;[†](#w-design)

Design language
: → Design system

Design system
: A structured collection of design particles, elements, and components, alongside documentation and guidelines as well as, occasionally, code and tools.

Design strategy
: The development and application of future-oriented design principles in order to increase an organization’s innovative and competitive qualities. Its foundations lie in the analysis of external and internal trends and data, which enables design decisions to be made on the basis of facts rather than aesthetics or intuition. Strategic design is regarded as an effective way to bridge innovation, research, management, and design.&nbsp;[†](#w-design-strategy)

Design vocabulary
: → Design system

Developer Experience
: The experience developers have when they work with developer infrastructure, tools, and documentation. DX is similar to User Experience in that many UX guidelines also apply to DX, but with the major difference that the user is a developer.

Developer Tools
: Tools for web developers to test and debug their code. They are different from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application.&nbsp;[†](#w-developer-tools)
: A set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser (Chrome DevTools). ℹ︎&nbsp;[developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)

Development Team
: A Scrum role denoting a team that is responsible for managing and doing all the work required to prepare a releasable increment of software, and that knows and follows the Scrum values, roles, and events.

Device pixel
: The physical pixels of a device.

DevOps
: A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information-technology operations (Ops) which aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.&nbsp;[†](#w-devops)

DHTML
: → Dynamic HTML

Dialog box
: A graphical control element in the form of a small window that communicates information to the user and prompts them for a response. Dialog boxes are classified as “modal” or “modeless,” depending on whether they block interaction with the software that initiated the dialog. The type of dialog box displayed is dependent upon the desired user interaction.&nbsp;[†](#w-dialog-box)

Digital Rights Management
: A set of access control technologies for restricting the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works. DRM technologies try to control the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works (such as software and multimedia content), as well as systems within devices that enforce these policies. The use of digital rights management is not universally accepted.&nbsp;[†](#w-drm)

Directionality
: The direction in which a text is written.

Display advertising
: Graphic advertising on Internet websites, apps, or social media through banners or other advertising formats made of text, images, Flash, video, and audio. The main purpose of display advertising is to deliver general advertisements and brand messages to site visitors.&nbsp;[†](#w-display-advertising)

Display resolution
: The number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed. It can be an ambiguous term especially as the displayed resolution is controlled by different factors in cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, flat-panel displays (including liquid-crystal displays) and projection displays using fixed picture-element (pixel) arrays. It is usually quoted as width × height, with the units in pixels; for example, 1024×768 means the width is 1024 pixels and the height is 768 pixels. For device displays such as phones, tablets, monitors, and televisions, the use of the word resolution as defined is a misnomer, though common. The term display resolution is usually used to mean pixel dimensions which does not tell anything about the pixel density of the display on which the image is actually formed: Resolution properly refers to the pixel density, the number of pixels per unit distance or area, not total number of pixels. In digital measurement, the display resolution would be given in pixels per inch (PPI).&nbsp;[†](#w-resolution)

Distributed Concurrent Versions System
: A distributed revision control system that enables software developers working on locally distributed sites to efficiently collaborate on a software project. DCVS is based on Concurrent Versions System.&nbsp;[†](#w-dcvs)

Distributed Version Control System
: A form of version control in which the complete codebase, including its full history, is mirrored on every developer’s computer. This enables automatic management branching and merging, speeds up of most operations (except pushing and pulling), improves the ability to work offline, and does not rely on a single location for backups.&nbsp;[†](#w-dvcs)

Dither
: An intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error, preventing large-scale patterns such as color banding in images. Dither is routinely used in processing of both digital audio and video data.&nbsp;[†](#w-dither)

Divitis
: Excessive use of `div` elements, an HTML anti-pattern.

Doctype
: An instruction that associates a particular SGML (for example, a web page) with a document type definition (DTD) (for example, the formal definition of a particular version of HTML) or XML document. The HTML layout engines in modern web browsers perform doctype sniffing or switching, wherein the doctype in a document served as `text/html` determines a layout mode, such as quirks mode or standards mode. The `text/html` serialization of HTML, which is not SGML-based, uses the doctype only for mode selection. Since web browsers are implemented with special-purpose HTML parsers, rather than general-purpose DTD-based parsers, they do not use DTDs and will not access them even if a URL is provided. The doctype is retained in current HTML as a “mostly useless, but required“ header only to trigger standards mode in common browsers.&nbsp;[†](#w-doctype)

Document directive
: A way to govern the properties of a document or worker environment to which a content security policy (CSP) applies. Document directives do not fall back to the `default-src` directive.&nbsp;[‡](#m-document-directive)

Document Object Model
: A cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document. Nodes can have event handlers attached to them.&nbsp;[†](#w-dom) ℹ︎&nbsp;[dom.spec.whatwg.org](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/)

Document type declaration
: → Doctype

Document Type Definition
: A set of markup declarations that define a document type for a SGML-family markup language (GML, SGML, XML, HTML). A DTD defines the valid building blocks of an XML document. It defines the document structure with a list of validated elements and attributes. A DTD can be declared inline inside an XML document, or as an external reference.&nbsp;[†](#w-dtd)

Documentation
: A set of documents provided on paper, or online, or on digital or analog media. Examples are user guides, white papers, on-line help, quick-reference guides. Paper or hard-copy documentation has become less common.&nbsp;[†](#w-documentation)

DOM
: → Document Object Model

Domain
: An administrative grouping of multiple private computer networks or hosts within the same infrastructure. Domains can be identified using a domain name; domains which need to be accessible from the public Internet can be assigned a globally unique name within the Domain Name System (DNS).&nbsp;[†](#w-domain)

Domain expert
: → Subject-Matter Expert

Domain name
: An identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet.&nbsp;[†](#w-domain-name)

Domain Name Service
: → Domain Name System

Domain Name System
: A hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.&nbsp;[†](#w-dns)

Domain of discourse
: The set of entities over which certain variables of interest in some formal treatment may range.&nbsp;[†](#w-domain-of-discourse)

Domain sharding
: The splitting of content across multiple subdomains. When multiple domains are used to serve multiple assets, browsers are able to download more resources simultaneously, resulting in a faster page load time and improved user experience. The problem with domain sharding, in terms of performance, is the cost of extra DNS lookups for each domain and the overhead of establishing each TCP connection.&nbsp;[‡](#m-domain-sharding)

Don’t Repeat Yourself
: A principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy. The DRY principle is stated as “Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.” The principle has been introduced by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book _The Pragmatic Programmer_.&nbsp;[†](#w-dry)

Doorway page
: A web page that is created for the deliberate manipulation of search engine indexes (spamdexing). A doorway page will affect the index of a search engine by inserting results for particular phrases while sending visitors to a different page. Doorway pages that redirect visitors without their knowledge use some form of cloaking. This usually falls under Black Hat SEO.&nbsp;[†](#w-doorway-page)

DoS
: → Denial of Service

Dot file
: A file (or folder) that starts with a dot character (for example, /home/user/.config). It is treated as hidden, that is, the `ls` command does not display them unless the `-a` flag (`ls -a`) is used. In most command-line shells, wildcards will not match files whose names start with “.” unless the wildcard itself starts with an explicit “.”. A convention arose of using dotfiles in the user’s home directory to store per-user configuration or informational text.&nbsp;[†](#w-hidden-file-dir)

Dot notation
: One of two ways to access object properties in JavaScript (`objectName.propertyName`), the other being bracket notation.

Dot-agnostic
: An configuration aspect for email that allows dots (“.”) anywhere within the local-part of the email address, to still refer to the same address. That is, when dot-agnostic, jane.doe@example.com, janedoe@example.com, and j.a.n.e.d.o.e@example.com would all be the same address and reach the same recipient.

Double
: A double-precision, 64-bit floating-point data type.

Downtime
: A period in which a system is unavailable. Downtime or outage duration refers to a period of time that a system fails to provide or perform its primary function. Reliability, availability, recovery, and unavailability are related concepts. The unavailability is the proportion of a timespan that a system is unavailable or offline. The term is commonly applied to networks and servers. The common reasons for unplanned outages are system failures (such as a crash) or communications failures (commonly known as network outage).&nbsp;[†](#w-downtime)

DQL

Duck typing
: An application of the duck test—“If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck”—to determine if an object can be used for a particular purpose. With normal typing, suitability is determined by an object’s type. In duck typing, an object’s suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the type of the object itself.&nbsp;[†](#w-duck-typing)

Dup
: → Duplicate code

Duplicate code
: A sequence of source code that occurs more than once, either within a program or across different programs owned or maintained by the same entity. Duplicate code is generally considered undesirable. A minimum requirement is usually applied to the quantity of code that must appear in a sequence for it to be considered duplicate rather than coincidentally similar. Sequences of duplicate code are sometimes known as code clones or just clones, the automated process of finding duplications in source code is called clone detection.&nbsp;[†](#w-duplicate-code)

DVCS
: → Distributed Version Control System

DX
: → Developer Experience

Dynamic
: A type of website being dynamic on the server or on the client side: A server-side dynamic website is a website whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new website proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing. A client-side dynamic website processes the website using HTML scripting running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the Document Object Model, or DOM, that represents the loaded website. The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way.&nbsp;[†](#w-dynamic)

Dynamic HTML
: A collection of technologies used together to create interactive and animated websites by using a combination of a static markup language (such as HTML), a client-side scripting language (such as JavaScript), a presentation definition language (such as CSS), and the Document Object Model (DOM). The application of DHTML was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer 4 in 1997.&nbsp;[†](#w-dynamic-html)

Dynamic password
: → One-Time Password

Dynamic typing
: An interpreter’s assigning at runtime of a type to a variable, based on the variable’s value at the time.&nbsp;[‡](#m-dynamic-typing)

Dyslexia
: A difficulty with reading despite normal intelligence. Different people are affected to varying degrees. Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, “sounding out” words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads.&nbsp;[†](#w-dyslexia)
