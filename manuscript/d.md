# D

Daily Scrum
: A daily Scrum event, time-boxed to 15 minutes, in which a Scrum Development Team plans the next development day.

Data
: Individual units of information. A datum describes a single quality or quantity of some object or phenomenon. In analytical processes, data are represented by variables. Data is sometimes said to be transformed into information when it is viewed in context or in post-analysis.&nbsp;[†](#w-data)

Database
: An organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Relational databases model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. Non-relational databases, also referred to as NoSQL, use different query languages.&nbsp;[†](#w-database)

Database Management System
: A “software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database.” The DBMS acronym is sometime extended to indicated the underlying database model, with RDBMS for relational, OODBMS or ORDBMS for the object (orientated) model and ORDBMS for Object-Relational. Other extensions can indicate some other characteristic, such as DDBMS for a distributed database management systems.&nbsp;[†](#w-database)

Debugging
: The process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling.&nbsp;[†](#w-debugging)

Declaration
: In CSS, a declaration assigns a value of a property (or, in case of a shorthand, several values for several properties) to a selected element. A declaration is part of a declaration block as well as a rule. It consists of a property, a colon (`:`), and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon (`;`) must be inserted to separate each declaration.&nbsp;[†](#w-css)

Decoration
: The attempt to make a physical or visual object more beautiful. Not to be confused with Design.

Decryption
: The opposite of encryption, or the reverse process of it, moving from unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext.&nbsp;[†](#w-cryptography)

Defect
: → Bug

Definition of Done
: A Scrum term that means a shared understanding of expectations that an increment must meet in order to be potentially releasable. Mutually defined by the Development Teams of an organization’s Scrum teams.

Demilitarized Zone
: A physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization’s external-facing services to an untrusted network, usually a larger network such as the Internet. The purpose of a DMZ is to add an additional layer of security to an organization’s local area network (LAN): an external network node can access only what is exposed in the DMZ, while the rest of the organization’s network is firewalled.&nbsp;[†](#w-dmz)

Denial of Service
: A cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.&nbsp;[†](#w-dos)

Deployment
: All of the activities that make a software system available for use. The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. Because every software system is unique, the precise processes or procedures within each activity are difficult to define. Therefore, “deployment” should be interpreted as a general process that has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics.&nbsp;[†](#w-deployment)

Deprecated
: → Deprecation

Deprecation
: The discouragement of use of some terminology, feature, design, or practice, typically because it has been superseded or is no longer considered efficient or safe, without completely removing it or prohibiting its use.&nbsp;[†](#w-deprecation)

Design
: A plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product, or process. The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment.&nbsp;[†](#w-design)

Design language
: → Design system

Design system
: A structured collection of design particles, elements, patterns, and components, alongside documentation and guidelines as well as, occasionally, code and tools.

Design strategy
: The development and application of future-oriented design principles in order to increase an organization’s innovative and competitive qualities. Its foundations lie in the analysis of external and internal trends and data, which enables design decisions to be made on the basis of facts rather than aesthetics or intuition. Strategic design is regarded as an effective way to bridge innovation, research, management, and design.&nbsp;[†](#w-design-strategy)

Design vocabulary
: → Design system

Developer Experience
: The experience developers have when they work with developer infrastructure, tools, and documentation. DX is similar to User Experience in that many UX guidelines also apply to DX, but with the major difference that the user is a developer.

Developer Tools
: Tools for web developers to test and debug their code. They are different from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application.&nbsp;[†](#w-developer-tools)
: A set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser (Chrome DevTools). ℹ︎&nbsp;[developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)

Development Team
: A Scrum role denoting a team that is responsible for managing and doing all the work required to prepare a releasable increment of software, and that knows and follows the Scrum values, roles, and events.

Device pixel
: The physical pixels of a device.

DevOps
: A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information-technology operations (Ops) which aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.&nbsp;[†](#w-devops)

DHTML
: → Dynamic HTML

Digital Rights Management
: A set of access control technologies for restricting the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works. DRM technologies try to control the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works (such as software and multimedia content), as well as systems within devices that enforce these policies. The use of digital rights management is not universally accepted.&nbsp;[†](#w-drm)

Directionality
: The direction in which a text is written.

Distributed Concurrent Versions System
: A distributed revision control system that enables software developers working on locally distributed sites to efficiently collaborate on a software project. DCVS is based on Concurrent Versions System.&nbsp;[†](#w-dcvs)

Distributed Version Control System
: A form of version control in which the complete codebase, including its full history, is mirrored on every developer’s computer. This enables automatic management branching and merging, speeds up of most operations (except pushing and pulling), improves the ability to work offline, and does not rely on a single location for backups.&nbsp;[†](#w-dvcs)

Dither
: An intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error, preventing large-scale patterns such as color banding in images. Dither is routinely used in processing of both digital audio and video data.&nbsp;[†](#w-dither)

DMZ

DNS
: → Domain Name Service

Doctype
: An instruction that associates a particular SGML (for example, a web page) with a document type definition (DTD) (for example, the formal definition of a particular version of HTML) or XML document. The HTML layout engines in modern web browsers perform doctype sniffing or switching, wherein the doctype in a document served as `text/html` determines a layout mode, such as quirks mode or standards mode. The `text/html` serialization of HTML, which is not SGML-based, uses the doctype only for mode selection. Since web browsers are implemented with special-purpose HTML parsers, rather than general-purpose DTD-based parsers, they don’t use DTDs and will not access them even if a URL is provided. The doctype is retained in current HTML as a “mostly useless, but required“ header only to trigger standards mode in common browsers.&nbsp;[†](#w-doctype)

Document directive
: A way to govern the properties of a document or worker environment to which a content security policy (CSP) applies. Document directives don’t fall back to the `default-src` directive.&nbsp;[‡](#m-document-directive)

Document Object Model
: A cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document. Nodes can have event handlers attached to them.&nbsp;[†](#w-dom) ℹ︎&nbsp;[dom.spec.whatwg.org](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/)

Document type declaration
: → Doctype

Document Type Definition
: A set of markup declarations that define a document type for a SGML-family markup language (GML, SGML, XML, HTML). A DTD defines the valid building blocks of an XML document. It defines the document structure with a list of validated elements and attributes. A DTD can be declared inline inside an XML document, or as an external reference.&nbsp;[†](#w-dtd)

Documentation
: A set of documents provided on paper, or online, or on digital or analog media. Examples are user guides, white papers, on-line help, quick-reference guides. Paper or hard-copy documentation has become less common.&nbsp;[†](#w-documentation)

DOM
: → Document Object Model

Domain
: An administrative grouping of multiple private computer networks or hosts within the same infrastructure. Domains can be identified using a domain name; domains which need to be accessible from the public Internet can be assigned a globally unique name within the Domain Name System (DNS).&nbsp;[†](#w-domain)

Domain name
: An identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet.&nbsp;[†](#w-domain-name)

Domain Name Service
: A hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.&nbsp;[†](#w-dns)

Domain sharding
: The splitting of content across multiple subdomains. When multiple domains are used to serve multiple assets, browsers are able to download more resources simultaneously, resulting in a faster page load time and improved user experience. The problem with domain sharding, in terms of performance, is the cost of extra DNS lookups for each domain and the overhead of establishing each TCP connection.&nbsp;[‡](#m-domain-sharding)

Don’t Repeat Yourself
: A principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy. The DRY principle is stated as “Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.” The principle has been introduced by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book _The Pragmatic Programmer_.&nbsp;[†](#w-dry)

Downtime
: A period in which a system is unavailable. Downtime or outage duration refers to a period of time that a system fails to provide or perform its primary function. Reliability, availability, recovery, and unavailability are related concepts. The unavailability is the proportion of a timespan that a system is unavailable or offline. The term is commonly applied to networks and servers. The common reasons for unplanned outages are system failures (such as a crash) or communications failures (commonly known as network outage).&nbsp;[†](#w-downtime)

Dynamic
: A type of website being dynamic on the server or on the client side: A _server-side_ dynamic website is a website whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new website proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing. A _client-side_ dynamic website processes the website using HTML scripting running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the Document Object Model, or DOM, that represents the loaded website. The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way.&nbsp;[†](#w-dynamic)

Dynamic HTML
: A collection of technologies used together to create interactive and animated websites by using a combination of a static markup language (such as HTML), a client-side scripting language (such as JavaScript), a presentation definition language (such as CSS), and the Document Object Model (DOM). The application of DHTML was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer 4 in 1997.&nbsp;[†](#w-dynamic-html)

Dynamic typing
: An interpreter’s assigning at runtime of a type to a variable, based on the variable’s value at the time.&nbsp;[‡](#m-dynamic-typing)
