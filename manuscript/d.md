# D

Daily Scrum
: A daily Scrum event, time-boxed to 15 minutes, in which a Scrum Development Team plans the next development day.

Data
: Individual units of information. A datum describes a single quality or quantity of some object or phenomenon. In analytical processes, data are represented by variables. Data is sometimes said to be transformed into information when it is viewed in context or in post-analysis.&nbsp;[†](#w-data)

DCVS
: → Distributed Concurrent Versions System

DDoS
: Distributed → Denial of Service

Debugging
: The process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling.&nbsp;[†](#w-debugging)

Declaration
: In CSS, a declaration assigns a value of a property (or, in case of a shorthand, several values for several properties) to a selected element. A declaration is part of a declaration block as well as a rule. It consists of a property, a colon (`:`), and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon (`;`) must be inserted to separate each declaration.&nbsp;[†](#w-declaration)

Decoration
: The attempt to make a physical or visual object more beautiful. Not to be confused with Design.

Decryption
: The opposite of encryption, or the reverse process of it, moving from unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext.&nbsp;[†](#w-cryptography)

Defect
: → Bug

Definition of Done
: A Scrum term that means a shared understanding of expectations that an increment must meet in order to be potentially releasable. Mutually defined by the Development Teams of an organization’s Scrum teams.

Demilitarized Zone
: A physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization’s external-facing services to an untrusted network, usually a larger network such as the Internet. The purpose of a DMZ is to add an additional layer of security to an organization’s local area network (LAN): an external network node can access only what is exposed in the DMZ, while the rest of the organization’s network is firewalled.&nbsp;[†](#w-dmz) 

Denial of Service
: A cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.&nbsp;[†](#w-dos)

Deployment
: All of the activities that make a software system available for use. The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. Because every software system is unique, the precise processes or procedures within each activity are difficult to define. Therefore, “deployment” should be interpreted as a general process that has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics.&nbsp;[†](#w-deployment)

Deprecated
: → Deprecation

Deprecation
: The discouragement of use of some terminology, feature, design, or practice, typically because it has been superseded or is no longer considered efficient or safe, without completely removing it or prohibiting its use.&nbsp;[†](#w-deprecation)

Design
: A plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product, or process. The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment.&nbsp;[†](#w-design)

Design language
: → Design system

Design system
: A structured collection of design particles, elements, patterns, and components, alongside documentation and guidelines as well as, occasionally, code and tools.

Design strategy
: The development and application of future-oriented design principles in order to increase an organization’s innovative and competitive qualities. Its foundations lie in the analysis of external and internal trends and data, which enables design decisions to be made on the basis of facts rather than aesthetics or intuition. Strategic design is regarded as an effective way to bridge innovation, research, management, and design.&nbsp;[†](#w-design-strategy)

Design vocabulary
: → Design system

Developer Experience
: The experience developers have when they work with developer infrastructure, tools, and documentation. DX is similar to User Experience in that many UX guidelines also apply to DX, but with the major difference that the user is a developer.

Development Team
: A Scrum role denoting a team that is responsible for managing and doing all the work required to prepare a releasable increment of software, and that knows and follows the Scrum values, roles, and events.

Developer Tools
: Tools for web developers to test and debug their code. They are different from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application.&nbsp;[†](#w-developer-tools)
: A set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser (Chrome DevTools). 🌍&nbsp;[developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)

Device pixel
: The physical pixels of a device.

DHTML
: → Dynamic HTML

Directionality
: The direction in which a text is written.

Distributed Concurrent Versions System
: A distributed revision control system that enables software developers working on locally distributed sites to efficiently collaborate on a software project. DCVS is based on Concurrent Versions System.&nbsp;[†](#w-dcvs)

Distributed Version Control System
: A form of version control in which the complete codebase, including its full history, is mirrored on every developer’s computer. This enables automatic management branching and merging, speeds up of most operations (except pushing and pulling), improves the ability to work offline, and does not rely on a single location for backups.&nbsp;[†](#w-dvcs)

Dither
: An intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error, preventing large-scale patterns such as color banding in images. Dither is routinely used in processing of both digital audio and video data.&nbsp;[†](#w-dither)
