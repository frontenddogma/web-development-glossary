`undefined`
: A primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared, or to formal arguments for which there are no actual arguments.&nbsp;[‡](#m-undefined)

Unicode
: A computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium, and as of May 2019 the most recent version, Unicode 12.1, contains a repertoire of 137,994 characters (consisting of 137,766 graphic characters, 163 format characters, and 65 control characters) covering 150 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets and emoji. The character repertoire of the Unicode Standard is synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646, and both are code-for-code identical.&nbsp;[†](#w-unicode)

Unicode Consortium
: A 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose primary purpose is to maintain and publish the Unicode Standard which was developed with the intention of replacing existing character encoding schemes which are limited in size and scope, and are incompatible with multilingual environments. The Consortium describes its overall purpose "to enable people around the world to use computers in any language, by providing freely available specifications and data to form the foundation for software internationalization in all major operating systems, search engines, applications, and the World Wide Web." Unicode's success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread adoption in the internationalization and localization of software. The standard has been implemented in many recent technologies, including XML, the Java programming language, Swift, and modern operating systems. The Unicode Consortium was founded in 1991.&nbsp;[†](#w-unicode-consortium) ℹ︎&nbsp;[unicode.org](https://unicode.org/)

Unified Modeling Language
: A general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system. The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design. It was developed in 1994/1995 by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh.&nbsp;[†](#w-uml) ℹ︎&nbsp;[uml.org](https://www.uml.org/)

Uninitialized variable
: A variable that is declared but is not set to a definite known value before it is used. It will have some value, but not a predictable one. As such, it is a programming error and a common source of bugs in software.&nbsp;[†](#w-uninitialized-variable)

Unit testing
: A software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run to ensure that a section of an application (known as the “unit”) meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure. In object-oriented programming, a unit is often an entire interface, such as a class, but could be an individual method.&nbsp;[†](#w-unit-testing)

Universal Design
: The design of buildings, products, or environments to make them accessible to all people, regardless of age, disability or other factors. The term “universal design” was coined by the architect Ronald Mace to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life. However, it was the work of Selwyn Goldsmith, author of _Designing for the Disabled_ (1963), who really pioneered the concept of free access for people with disabilities. His most significant achievement was the creation of the dropped curb—now a standard feature of the built environment.&nbsp;[†](#w-universal-design)

Usenet
: A worldwide distributed discussion system available on computers. It was developed from the general-purpose Unix-to-Unix Copy (UUCP) dial-up network architecture. Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis conceived the idea in 1979, and Usenet was established in 1980. Users read and post messages (called articles or posts, and collectively termed news) to one or more categories, known as newsgroups. Usenet resembles a bulletin board system (BBS) in many respects and is the precursor to Internet forums that are widely used today.&nbsp;[†](#w-usenet)
