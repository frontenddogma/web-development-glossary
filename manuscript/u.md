Unicode
: A computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium, and as of May 2019 the most recent version, Unicode 12.1, contains a repertoire of 137,994 characters (consisting of 137,766 graphic characters, 163 format characters, and 65 control characters) covering 150 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets and emoji. The character repertoire of the Unicode Standard is synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646, and both are code-for-code identical.&nbsp;[†](#w-unicode)

Unicode Consortium
: A 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose primary purpose is to maintain and publish the Unicode Standard which was developed with the intention of replacing existing character encoding schemes which are limited in size and scope, and are incompatible with multilingual environments. The Consortium describes its overall purpose "to enable people around the world to use computers in any language, by providing freely available specifications and data to form the foundation for software internationalization in all major operating systems, search engines, applications, and the World Wide Web." Unicode's success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread adoption in the internationalization and localization of software. The standard has been implemented in many recent technologies, including XML, the Java programming language, Swift, and modern operating systems. The Unicode Consortium was founded in 1991.&nbsp;[†](#w-unicode-consortium) ℹ︎&nbsp;[unicode.org](https://unicode.org/)

Unified Modeling Language
: A general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system. The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design. It was developed in 1994/1995 by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh.&nbsp;[†](#w-uml) ℹ︎&nbsp;[uml.org](https://www.uml.org/)

Uniform Resource Identifier
: A string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules, but also maintain extensibility through a separately defined hierarchical naming scheme (e.g. `http://`). An identification as with URIs enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The most common form of URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.&nbsp;[†](#w-uri)

Uniform Resource Locator
: A reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), although many people use the two terms interchangeably. URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (`http`), but are also used for file transfer (`ftp`), email (`mailto`), database access (JDBC), and many other applications. Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar. A typical URL could have the form `http://www.example.com/contact.html`, which indicates a protocol (`http`), a hostname (`www.example.com`), and a file name (`contact.html`). Uniform Resource Locators were defined in RFC 1738 in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and the URI working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).&nbsp;[†](#w-url)

Uniform Resource Name
: A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that uses the `urn` scheme. URNs were originally conceived to be part of a three-part information architecture for the Internet, along with Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and Uniform Resource Characteristics (URCs), a metadata framework. URNs were conceived as persistent, location-independent identifiers assigned within defined namespaces. Since RFC 3986 in 2005, use of the terms "Uniform Resource Name" and "Uniform Resource Locator" has been deprecated in technical standards in favor of the term Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which encompasses both.&nbsp;[†](#w-urn)

Uninitialized pointer
: → Uninitialized variable

Uninitialized variable
: A variable that is declared but is not set to a definite known value before it is used. It will have some value, but not a predictable one. As such, it is a programming error and a common source of bugs in software.&nbsp;[†](#w-uninitialized-variable)

Unit testing
: A software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run to ensure that a section of an application (known as the “unit”) meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure. In object-oriented programming, a unit is often an entire interface, such as a class, but could be an individual method.&nbsp;[†](#w-unit-testing)

Universal Design
: The design of buildings, products, or environments to make them accessible to all people, regardless of age, disability or other factors. The term “universal design” was coined by the architect Ronald Mace to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life. However, it was the work of Selwyn Goldsmith, author of _Designing for the Disabled_ (1963), who really pioneered the concept of free access for people with disabilities. His most significant achievement was the creation of the dropped curb—now a standard feature of the built environment.&nbsp;[†](#w-universal-design)

Universal Module Definition
: A collection of patterns and scripts to help use and compatibility of different JavaScript module loaders. ℹ︎&nbsp;[github.com/umdjs/umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd)

Unix/UNIX
: A family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. Initially intended for use inside the Bell System, AT&T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s, leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants. Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the “Unix philosophy.” Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system: almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language, thus allowing Unix to reach numerous platforms.&nbsp;[†](#w-unix)

Unix Philosophy
: A set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development. It is based on the experience of leading developers of the Unix operating system. Early Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice, spawning a “software tools” movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software; these norms became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the “Unix philosophy.” The Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy favors composability as opposed to monolithic design.&nbsp;[†](#w-unix-philosophy) ℹ︎&nbsp;[is.gd/oOiBbo](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html)

URL

URL encoding
: A mechanism for encoding information in a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) under certain circumstances. Although it is known as URL encoding, it is, in fact, used more generally within the main Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) set, which includes both Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and Uniform Resource Name (URN). As such, it is also used in the preparation of data of the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` media type, as is often used in the submission of HTML form data in HTTP requests. With URL encoding, when a reserved character has special meaning in a certain context, and a URI scheme says that it is necessary to use that character for some other purpose, then the character must be percent-encoded. For example, `/` becomes `%2F`.&nbsp;[†](#w-percent-encoding)

Usability
: The ease of use and learnability of a human-made object such as a tool or device. In software engineering, usability is the degree to which a software can be used by specified consumers to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use. Usability includes methods of measuring usability, such as needs analysis and the study of the principles behind an object's perceived efficiency or elegance. In human-computer interaction and computer science, usability studies the elegance and clarity with which the interaction with a computer program or a web site (web usability) is designed. Usability considers user satisfaction and utility as quality components, and aims to improve user experience through iterative design.&nbsp;[†](#w-usability)

Usability testing
: A technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users. This can be seen as an irreplaceable usability practice, since it gives direct input on how real users use the system. Usability testing is more concerned with the design intuitiveness of the product and tested with users who have no prior exposure to it. Such testing is paramount to the success of an end product as a fully functioning app that creates confusion amongst its users will not last for long. This is in contrast with usability inspection methods where experts use different methods to evaluate a user interface without involving users.&nbsp;[†](#w-usability-testing)

Usenet
: A worldwide distributed discussion system available on computers. It was developed from the general-purpose Unix-to-Unix Copy (UUCP) dial-up network architecture. Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis conceived the idea in 1979, and Usenet was established in 1980. Users read and post messages (called articles or posts, and collectively termed news) to one or more categories, known as newsgroups. Usenet resembles a bulletin board system (BBS) in many respects and is the precursor to Internet forums that are widely used today.&nbsp;[†](#w-usenet)
