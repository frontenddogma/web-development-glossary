QC
: → Quality Control

Quality
: The non-inferiority or superiority of something; quality is also defined as being suitable for its intended purpose (fitness for purpose) while satisfying customer expectations. Quality is a perceptual, conditional, and somewhat subjective attribute and may be understood differently by different people. Consumers may focus on the specification quality of a product or service, or how it compares to competitors in the marketplace. Producers might measure the conformance quality, or degree to which the product or service was produced correctly. Support personnel may measure quality in the degree that a product is reliable, maintainable, or sustainable.&nbsp;[†](#w-quality)

Quality Assurance
: A way of preventing mistakes and defects in manufactured products and avoiding problems when delivering products or services to customers; which ISO 9000 defines as “part of quality management focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled.” This defect prevention in quality assurance differs subtly from defect detection and rejection in quality control and has been referred to as a shift left since it focuses on quality earlier in the process (i.e., to the left of a linear process diagram reading left to right).&nbsp;[†](#w-qa)

Quality Control
: A process by which entities review the quality of all factors involved in production. ISO 9000 defines quality control as “a part of quality management focused on fulfilling quality requirements.” QC places emphasis on three aspects: elements such as controls, job management, defined and well managed processes, performance and integrity criteria, and identification of records; competence, such as knowledge, skills, experience, and qualifications; and soft elements, such as personnel, integrity, confidence, organizational culture, motivation, team spirit, and quality relationships.&nbsp;[†](#w-qc)

Quantity Query
: A complex CSS selector that allows styles to be applied to elements based on the number of siblings. The term may have first been coined in 2015 by Heydon Pickering. ℹ︎&nbsp;[quantityqueries.com](https://quantityqueries.com/)

Query
: A form of questioning, in a line of inquiry. In computing, a precise request for information retrieval.&nbsp;[†](#w-query)

Query language
: A language to make queries in databases and information systems. Query languages can be classified according to whether they are database query languages or information retrieval query languages. The difference is that a database query language attempts to give factual answers to factual questions, while an information retrieval query language attempts to find documents containing information that is relevant to an area of inquiry.&nbsp;[†](#w-query-language)

QUIC
: → Quick UDP Internet Connection

Quick UDP Internet Connection
: A general-purpose transport-layer network protocol initially designed by Jim Roskind at Google, implemented, and deployed in 2012, announced publicly in 2013 as experimentation broadened, and described to the IETF. While still an Internet Draft, QUIC is used by more than half of all connections from the Chrome web browser to Google’s servers. Most other web browsers do not support the protocol. Among other applications, QUIC improves performance of connection-oriented web applications that are currently using TCP.&nbsp;[†](#w-quic)

Quirks mode
: A technique used by some web browsers for maintaining backward compatibility with web pages designed for old web browsers, instead of strictly complying with respective standards in strict mode. One prominent difference between quirks and strict mode is the handling of the CSS box model. Before version 6, Internet Explorer used an algorithm for determining the width of an element’s box which conflicted with the algorithm detailed in the CSS specification, and due to Internet Explorer’s popularity many pages were created which relied upon this non-standard algorithm, or used a box model hack.&nbsp;[†](#w-quirks-mode)
