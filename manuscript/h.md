Hashtag
: A type of metadata tag used on social networks such as Twitter and other microblogging services. It lets users apply dynamic, user-generated tagging that helps other users easily find messages with a specific theme or content. Users create and use hashtags by placing an octothorpe (`#`, also called a number sign, or pound sign) usually in front of a word or unspaced phrase in a message. Searching for that hashtag yields each message that someone has tagged with it. A hashtag archive is consequently collected into a single stream under the same hashtag.&nbsp;[†](#w-hashtag)

hasLayout
: A peculiarity in Internet Explorer ≤8 that influences how page elements are drawn or interact. Though some elements “automatically” “have layout,” hasLayout can also be forced by particular CSS properties and declarations. ℹ︎&nbsp;[sitepoint.com/internet-explorer-haslayout-property](https://www.sitepoint.com/internet-explorer-haslayout-property/)

Hick’s Law
: A model describing the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices he or she has: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically. Hick’s Law assesses cognitive information capacity in choice reaction experiments. The amount of time taken to process a certain amount of bits in the Hick–Hyman law is known as the rate of gain of information.&nbsp;[†](#w-hicks-law)

High Efficiency Image Coding
: → High Efficiency Image File Format

High Efficiency Image File Format
: A file format for individual images and image sequences. It was developed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) and is defined by MPEG-H Part 12 (ISO/IEC 23008-12). The MPEG group claims that twice as much information can be stored in a HEIF image as in a JPEG image of the same size, resulting in a better quality image. HEIF also supports animation, and is capable of storing more information than an animated GIF at a small fraction of the size.&nbsp;[†](#w-heif)

Hit
: A request to a web server for a file (such as a web page, image, script, or style sheet). There may be many hits per page view since an HTML page can contain multiple files, such as images.&nbsp;[†](#w-hit)

Hoisting
: A general way of thinking about how execution contexts (specifically the creation and execution phases) work in JavaScript. While conceptually, a strict definition of hoisting suggests that variable and function declarations are physically moved to the top of your code, the variable and function declarations are instead put into memory during the compile phase. Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.&nbsp;[‡](#m-hoisting)

Holey
: A property of an array that misses elements, and cannot be optimized as effectively anymore.

Home Screen
: The main screen on a mobile operating system or computer program. Home screens are not identical because users can rearrange icons as they please, and home screens often differ across mobile operating systems. Almost every smartphone has some form of home screen, which typically displays links to applications, settings, and notifications.&nbsp;[†](#w-home-screen)

HTML/CSS framework
: A library allowing for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with more features and additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and focused around interactive UI patterns. This detail differentiates CSS (or HTML/CSS) frameworks from other JavaScript frameworks.&nbsp;[†](#w-css-framework)
