Hashtag
: A type of metadata tag used on social networks such as Twitter and other microblogging services. It lets users apply dynamic, user-generated tagging that helps other users easily find messages with a specific theme or content. Users create and use hashtags by placing an octothorpe (`#`, also called a number sign, or pound sign) usually in front of a word or unspaced phrase in a message. Searching for that hashtag yields each message that someone has tagged with it. A hashtag archive is consequently collected into a single stream under the same hashtag.&nbsp;[†](#w-hashtag)

hasLayout
: A peculiarity in Internet Explorer ≤8 that influences how page elements are drawn or interact. Though some elements “automatically” “have layout,” hasLayout can also be forced by particular CSS properties and declarations. ℹ︎&nbsp;[sitepoint.com/internet-explorer-haslayout-property](https://www.sitepoint.com/internet-explorer-haslayout-property/)

Hick’s Law
: A model describing the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices he or she has: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically. Hick’s Law assesses cognitive information capacity in choice reaction experiments. The amount of time taken to process a certain amount of bits in the Hick–Hyman law is known as the rate of gain of information.&nbsp;[†](#w-hicks-law)

HTML/CSS framework
: A library allowing for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with more features and additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and focused around interactive UI patterns. This detail differentiates CSS (or HTML/CSS) frameworks from other JavaScript frameworks.&nbsp;[†](#w-css-framework)
