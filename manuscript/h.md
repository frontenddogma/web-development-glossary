: A library allowing for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with more features and additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and focused around interactive UI patterns. This detail differentiates CSS (or HTML/CSS) frameworks from other JavaScript frameworks.&nbsp;[†](#w-css-framework)
