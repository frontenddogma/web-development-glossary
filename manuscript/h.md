# H

Hard reset
: An early 2000s reset “style sheet” that resets the margins and paddings of all elements (`* { margin: 0; padding: 0; }`).

Hashtag
: A type of metadata tag used on social networks such as Twitter and other microblogging services. It lets users apply dynamic, user-generated tagging that helps other users easily find messages with a specific theme or content. Users create and use hashtags by placing an octothorpe (`#`, also called a number sign, or pound sign) usually in front of a word or unspaced phrase in a message. Searching for that hashtag yields each message that someone has tagged with it. A hashtag archive is consequently collected into a single stream under the same hashtag.&nbsp;[†](#w-hashtag)

hasLayout
: A peculiarity in Internet Explorer ≤8 that influences how page elements are drawn or interact. Though some elements “automatically” “have layout,” hasLayout can also be forced by particular CSS properties and declarations. ℹ︎&nbsp;[sitepoint.com/internet-explorer-haslayout-property](https://www.sitepoint.com/internet-explorer-haslayout-property/)

Heading content
: Content that defines the header of a section (whether explicitly marked up using sectioning content elements, or implied by the heading content itself), marked up through the `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, and `hgroup` elements.&nbsp;§

Hick’s Law
: A model describing the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices he or she has: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically. Hick’s Law assesses cognitive information capacity in choice reaction experiments. The amount of time taken to process a certain amount of bits in the Hick-Hyman law is known as the rate of gain of information.&nbsp;[†](#w-hicks-law)

High Efficiency Image Coding
: → High Efficiency Image File Format

High Efficiency Image File Format
: A file format for individual images and image sequences. It was developed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) and is defined by MPEG-H Part 12 (ISO/IEC 23008-12). The MPEG group claims that twice as much information can be stored in a HEIF image as in a JPEG image of the same size, resulting in a better quality image. HEIF also supports animation, and is capable of storing more information than an animated GIF at a small fraction of the size.&nbsp;[†](#w-heif)

Hit
: A request to a web server for a file (such as a web page, image, script, or style sheet). There may be many hits per page view since an HTML page can contain multiple files, such as images.&nbsp;[†](#w-hit)

HOC
: → Higher-Order Component

Hoisting
: A general way of thinking about how execution contexts (specifically the creation and execution phases) work in JavaScript. While conceptually, a strict definition of hoisting suggests that variable and function declarations are physically moved to the top of your code, the variable and function declarations are instead put into memory during the compile phase. Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.&nbsp;[‡](#m-hoisting)

Holey
: A property of an array that misses elements, and cannot be optimized as effectively anymore.

Home page
: The initial or main web page of a website or a browser. The initial page of a website is sometimes called main page as well.&nbsp;[†](#w-home-page)

Home screen
: The main screen on a mobile operating system or computer program. Home screens are not identical because users can rearrange icons as they please, and home screens often differ across mobile operating systems. Almost every smartphone has some form of home screen, which typically displays links to applications, settings, and notifications.&nbsp;[†](#w-home-screen)

HomeSite
: A discontinued HTML editor originally developed in 1996 by Nick Bradbury. Unlike WYSIWYG HTML editors such as FrontPage and Dreamweaver, HomeSite was designed for direct editing, or “hand coding,” of HTML and other website languages. After a successful partnership with the company to distribute it alongside its own competing Dreamweaver software, HomeSite was acquired by Macromedia in 2001, after which elements of the software were integrated into Dreamweaver. Following the acquisition of Macromedia by Adobe Systems, the company announced in 2009 that HomeSite would be discontinued.&nbsp;[†](#w-homesite)

Houdini
: A set of low level APIs that give developers the power to extend CSS, providing the ability to hook into the styling and layout process of a browser’s rendering engine. Houdini gives developers access to the CSS Object Model (CSSOM), enabling developers to write code the browser can parse as CSS. The benefit of Houdini is that developers can create CSS features without waiting for web standards specifications to define them and without waiting for every browser to fully implement the features.&nbsp;[‡](#m-houdini) ℹ︎&nbsp;[ishoudinireadyyet.com](https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/)

HTML/CSS framework
: A library allowing for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with more features and additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and focused around interactive UI patterns. This detail differentiates CSS (or HTML/CSS) frameworks from other JavaScript frameworks.&nbsp;[†](#w-css-framework)

HTTP
: → Hypertext Transfer Protocol

HTTP Strict Transport Security
: A web security policy mechanism that helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. It allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should interact with it using only HTTPS connections, which provide Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL), unlike the insecure HTTP protocol used alone. The HSTS policy is communicated by the server to the user agent via an HTTPS response header field named `Strict-Transport-Security`. HSTS policy specifies a period of time during which the user agent should only access the server in a secure fashion.&nbsp;[†](#w-hsts)

Human-Computer Interaction
: The study of the design and use of computer technology, focused on the interfaces between people (users) and computers. Researchers in the field of HCI observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways. As a field of research, human–computer interaction is situated at the intersection of computer science, behavioural sciences, design, media studies, and several other fields of study.&nbsp;[†](#w-hci)

Hyperlink
: → Link

Hypertext
: Text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access. Hypertext documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress set, or by touching the screen. Apart from text, the term “hypertext” is also sometimes used to describe tables, images, and other presentational content formats with integrated hyperlinks. Hypertext is one of the key underlying concepts of the World Wide Web.&nbsp;[†](#w-hypertext)

HyperText Markup Language
: The standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML and its elements describe the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML was first presented in 1991.&nbsp;[†](#w-html) ℹ︎&nbsp;[html.spec.whatwg.org](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)

Hypertext Preprocessor
: A general-purpose programming language originally designed for web development. It was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for “Personal Home Page,” but it now stands for the recursive initialism “Hypertext Preprocessor.” PHP code may be executed with a command line interface (CLI), embedded into HTML code, or used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server outputs the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML code or binary image data. PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context.&nbsp;[†](#w-php) ℹ︎&nbsp;[php.net](https://www.php.net/)

Hypertext Transfer Protocol
: An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser. Development of HTTP was initiated in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Development of early HTTP Requests for Comments (RFCs) was a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.&nbsp;[†](#w-http)

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
: An extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTPS is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also often referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL. The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website, protection of the privacy, and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. The bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects against eavesdropping and tampering of the communication. The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server side digital certificates, which historically was expensive.&nbsp;[†](#w-https)
