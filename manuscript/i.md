ID selector
: A selector that matches an HTML element based on the value of the element’s `id` attribute. The selector is based on a “#” followed by the `id` attribute’s value. ID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors.

IDE
: → Integrated Development Environment

Identifier
: A name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique object or a unique class of objects, where the “object” or class may be an idea, physical, or countable object (or class thereof), or physical or uncountable substance (or class thereof). The abbreviation “ID” often refers to identity, identification (the process of identifying), or an identifier (that is, an instance of identification). An identifier may be a word, number, letter, symbol, or any combination of those.&nbsp;[†](#w-id)

Image
: An artifact that depicts visual perception, such as a photograph or other two-dimensional picture, particularly one that resembles a subject (usually a physical object). In the context of signal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color. In web development, an image often refers to an image file or element.&nbsp;[†](#w-image)

Image map
: A list of coordinates relating to a specific image, created in order to hyperlink areas of the image to different destinations (as opposed to a normal image link, in which the entire area of the image links to a single destination). Image maps can be created in different ways, from server-side image maps relying on the `ismap` attribute to client-side image maps using the `map` and `area` elements, or a combination of list markup and CSS styling.&nbsp;[†](#w-image-map)

Image replacement
: An early web design technique that uses CSS to replace text on a web page with an image containing that text. Image replacement is intended to keep the page accessible to users of screen readers, text-only web browsers, or other browsers where support for images or style sheets is either disabled or non-existent, while allowing the image to differ between styles.&nbsp;[†](#w-image-replacement) ℹ︎&nbsp;[is.gd/LVXQZj](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmeiert.com%2Fde%2Fpublications%2Farticles%2F20050513%2F)

IMAP

Immediately Invoked Function Expression
: A JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The IIFE is a design pattern which is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function and contains two major parts: The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator (`()`). This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope. The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression (`()`) through which the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the function.&nbsp;[‡](#m-iife)

Immutable
: A property of an object whose state cannot be modified after it was created (an immutable or unchangeable object). This is in contrast to a mutable object. In some cases, an object is considered immutable even if some internally used attributes change, but the object’s state appears to be unchanging from an external point of view. Strings and other concrete objects are typically expressed as immutable objects to improve readability and runtime efficiency in object-oriented programming. Immutable objects are also useful because they are inherently thread-safe.&nbsp;[†](#w-immutable)

In-App Browser
: A browser instance in a mobile application, usually working on the basis of WebViews (Android) or WKWebViews (iOS).

Inclusive Design
: → Universal Design

Increment
: A term from the Scrum framework that describes all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint, and the value of the increments of prior Sprints. The Increment is created by members of the Development Team. It must be usable and meet the definition of “Done.”

Indexed color
: A technique to manage digital images’ colors in a limited fashion, in order to save computer memory and file storage, while speeding up display refresh and file transfers. Indexed color is a form of vector quantization compression. When an image is encoded this way, color information is not directly carried by the image pixel data, but stored in a separate piece of data called a palette, that is, an array of color elements.&nbsp;[†](#w-indexed-color)

Indexed Database
: A JavaScript API provided by web browsers for managing a NoSQL database of JSON objects. As an alternative to the web storage standard, IndexedDB can provide more storage capacity. Use cases for IndexedDB include caching web application data for offline availability.&nbsp;[†](#w-indexeddb) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/IndexedDB](https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/)

IndieWeb
: A community of individual personal websites, connected by simple standards, based on the principles of owning your domain, using it as your primary identity, to publish on your own site (optionally syndicate elsewhere), and own your data. ℹ︎&nbsp;[indieweb.org](https://indieweb.org/)

Industrial Design
: A process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured through techniques of mass production. Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: The creative act of determining and defining a product’s form and features takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication and distinguishes industrial design from craft-based design.&nbsp;[†](#w-industrial-design)

Infinite scrolling
: The dynamic loading of additional web page content, usually when a user starts scrolling, so that it seems as if they could scroll indefinitely. Infinite scrolling can be problematic from a user perspective if there is useful or important information at the end of a page that cannot be reached because of the continued adding of content.

Information architecture
: The structural design of shared information environments; the art and science of organizing and labeling websites, intranets, online communities, and software to support usability and findability; and an emerging community of practice focused on bringing principles of design, architecture, and information science to the digital landscape. Typically, IA involves a model or concept of information that is used and applied to activities which require explicit details of complex information systems. These activities include library systems and database development.&nbsp;[†](#w-ia)

Information Design
: The practice of presenting information in a way that fosters an efficient and effective understanding of the information. The term has come to be used for a specific area of graphic design related to displaying information effectively, rather than just attractively or for artistic expression. Information design is closely related to the field of data visualization. The broad applications of information design along with its close connections to other fields of design and communication practices have created some overlap in the definitions of communication design, data visualization, and information architecture.&nbsp;[†](#w-information-design)

Information foraging
: A theory that applies the ideas from optimal foraging theory to understand how human users search for information. The theory is based on the assumption that, when searching for information, humans use “built-in” foraging mechanisms that evolved to help our animal ancestors find food. Importantly, better understanding of human search behavior can improve the usability of websites or any other user interface.&nbsp;[†](#w-information-foraging)

Information overload
: The difficulty in understanding an issue and effectively making decisions when one has too much information about that issue. Generally, the term is associated with the excessive quantity of daily information. Information overload most likely originated from information theory, which are studies in the storage, preservation, communication, compression, and extraction of information.&nbsp;[†](#w-information-overload)

Information retrieval
: The activity of obtaining information system resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of those resources. Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the metadata that describes data, and for databases of texts, images, or sounds.&nbsp;[†](#w-information-retrieval)

Information scent
: Cues in the information environment pointing to possible answers. Human users estimate how much useful information they are likely to get on a given path, and after seeking information compare the actual outcome with their predictions. When the information scent stops getting stronger (i.e., when users no longer expect to find useful additional information), users move to a different information source. Poor information scent is one reason for the ineffectiveness of “(click) here” and “(learn) more” links.&nbsp;[†](#w-information-foraging)

Information Security
: The practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. Information Security is part of information risk management, and typically involves preventing or at least reducing the probability of unauthorized or inappropriate access, use, disclosure, disruption, deletion or destruction, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or devaluation, although it may also involve reducing the adverse impacts of incidents. Information may take any form, e.g., electronic or physical, tangible (e.g., paperwork) or intangible (e.g., knowledge). The primary focus of Information Security is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.&nbsp;[†](#w-infosec)

Infosec
: → Information Security

Infrastructure as a Service
: Online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, or backup. A hypervisor runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud-operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to varying requirements.&nbsp;[†](#w-iaas)

Infrastructure as Code
: The process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.&nbsp;[†](#w-iac)

Inheritance
: The mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes (sub classes) from existing ones (super class or base class) and forming them into a hierarchy of classes. In most class-based object-oriented languages, an object created through inheritance (a “child object”) acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent object (except: constructors, destructors, overloaded operators, and friend functions of the base class). Inheritance allows to create classes that are built upon existing classes, to specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface), to reuse code, and to independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces.&nbsp;[†](#w-inheritance)

: → Inline-level element

Inline formatting context
: A formatting context in which boxes are laid out horizontally. Horizontal padding, borders, and margins are respected.

Inline linking
: The use (embedding) of a linked object, often an image, on one website by a web page belonging to a second site. One website is said to have an inline link to the other site where the object is located.&nbsp;[†](#w-inline-linking)

Inline replying
: → Interleaved posting

Inline-level box
: A box generated by an inline-level element.

Inline-level element
: An element that does not form new blocks of content and whose content is distributed in lines.

`innerHTML`
: A DOM attribute that can be used to get and set the markup within the respective element. Use of the property is considered bad practice because of possible security and performance issues.

Input/Output
: The communication between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system. Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it.&nbsp;[†](#w-io)

Instance variable
: A variable defined in a class for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is declared in a class but outside a constructor, method, or block; it is created when an object is instantiated. Instance variables are accessible to all constructors, methods, and blocks in the class.&nbsp;[†](#w-instance-variable)

Instant Articles
: A feature from social networking company Facebook for use with collaborating news and content publishers, that the publisher can choose to use for articles they select. When a publisher selects an article for Instant Articles, people browsing Facebook with the Facebook mobile app can see the entire article within the app, with formatting very similar to that on the publisher’s website.&nbsp;[†](#w-instant-articles) ℹ︎&nbsp;[instantarticles.fb.com](https://instantarticles.fb.com/)

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
: A professional association that was formed in 1963 from the amalgamation of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio Engineers. The IEEE’s objectives are the educational and technical advancement of electrical and electronic engineering, telecommunications, computer engineering, and associated disciplines.&nbsp;[†](#w-ieee) ℹ︎&nbsp;[ieee.org](https://www.ieee.org/)

Instrument flight
: The deploying and releasing of untested code.

Integer
: In computer science, a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). With 32 bits, an integer has a signed range from –2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, and an unsigned range from 0 to 4,294,967,295.&nbsp;[†](#w-integer-computer-science)
: In mathematics, a number that can be written without a fractional component. For example, 21, 4, 0, and −2048 are integers, while 9.75, 5½, and √2 are not. The set of integers consists of zero (0), the positive natural numbers (1, 2, 3, …), also called whole numbers or counting numbers, and their additive inverses (the negative integers, i.e., –1, –2, –3, …).&nbsp;[†](#w-integer-math)

Integrated Development Environment
: A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Some IDEs contain the necessary compiler, interpreter, or both.&nbsp;[†](#w-ide)

Intellectual Property
: A category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The most well-known types are copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation. The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is “indivisible,” since an unlimited number of people can “consume” an intellectual good without it being depleted.&nbsp;[†](#w-intellectual-property)

IntelliJ IDEA
: An integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java for developing computer software. IntelliJ IDEA is developed by JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ) and was first released in 2001.&nbsp;[†](#w-intellij-idea) ℹ︎&nbsp;[jetbrains.com/idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Intent to Implement
: → Intent to Prototype

Intent to Prototype
: A software vendor expression to develop a particular software or software feature. This implementation may not necessarily lead to a public release but instead serve to assess feasibility, desirability, and cost.

Interaction Design
: The practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services. Beyond the digital aspect, interaction design is also useful when creating physical (non-digital) products, exploring how a user might interact with it. Common topics of interaction design include design, human-computer interaction, and software development. While interaction design has an interest in form (similar to other design fields), its main area of focus rests on behavior.&nbsp;[†](#w-ixd)

Interaction Design Association
: A member-supported organization for the field of interaction design. The IxDA was founded in 2003. ℹ︎&nbsp;[ixda.org](https://ixda.org/)

Interactive Advertising Bureau

Interactive content
: Content that is specifically intended for user interaction.&nbsp;§

Interface
: A shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information. The exchange can be between software, computer hardware, peripheral devices, humans, and combinations of these. Some computer hardware devices, such as a touchscreen, can both send and receive data through the interface, while others such as a mouse or microphone may only provide an interface to send data to a given system.&nbsp;[†](#w-interface)
: → Graphical User Interface
: → User Interface

Interface Segregation Principle
: The principle that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them. Such shrunken interfaces are also called role interfaces. ISP is intended to keep a system decoupled and thus easier to refactor, change, and redeploy.&nbsp;[†](#w-interface-segregation)

Interleaved posting
: A posting style in which the different parts of the reply follow the relevant parts of the original post.&nbsp;[†](#w-posting-style)

Internal

Internet
: The global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices world-wide. The Internet is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.&nbsp;[†](#w-internet)

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
: A function of ICANN that is responsible for the allocation of globally unique names and numbers that are used in Internet protocols, and for the assignment of Internet numbers which are numerical identifier assigned to an Internet resource or used in the networking protocols of the Internet protocol suite. Examples include IP addresses and autonomous system (AS) numbers. IANA was founded in 1988.&nbsp;[†](#w-iana) ℹ︎&nbsp;[iana.org](https://www.iana.org/)

Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
: A non-profit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network’s stable and secure operation. ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of central Internet address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function contract. ICANN was founded in 1998.&nbsp;[†](#w-icann) ℹ︎&nbsp;[icann.org](https://www.icann.org/)

Internet Explorer
: A series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included in the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows&nbsp;95 that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows&nbsp;95 and later versions of Windows. The browser is discontinued, but still maintained.&nbsp;[†](#w-ie) ℹ︎&nbsp;[is.gd/nJZDm3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer.aspx)

Internet Message Access Protocol
: An Internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection. IMAP was designed in 1986 and is defined by RFC&nbsp;3501.&nbsp;[†](#w-imap)

Internet Protocol
: The principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables inter-networking, and essentially establishes the Internet.&nbsp;[†](#w-internet-protocol)

Internet Relay Chat
: An application-layer protocol that facilitates communication in the form of text. The chat process works on a client/server networking model. IRC clients are computer programs that users can install on their system or web based applications running either locally in the browser or on a 3rd party server. IRC was created in 1988 by Jarkko Oikarinen.&nbsp;[†](#w-irc)

Internet Resource Locator
: A locator defined by an Internet resource location standard.

Internet Service Provider

Internet Society
: A non-profit organization founded in 1992 to provide leadership in Internet-related standards, education, access, and policy. The ISOC’s mission is “to promote the open development, evolution, and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world.”&nbsp;[†](#w-isoc) ℹ︎&nbsp;[internetsociety.org](https://www.internetsociety.org/)

Interoperability
: A characteristic of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with other products or systems, at present or in the future, in either implementation or access, without any restrictions.&nbsp;[†](#w-interoperability)

Intersection Observer
: An API providing a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document’s viewport. Historically, detecting visibility of an element, or the relative visibility of two elements in relation to each other, has been a difficult task for which solutions have been unreliable and prone to causing browsers and sites to become sluggish. The Intersection Observer API lets code register a callback function that is executed whenever an element they wish to monitor enters or exits another element (or the viewport), or when the amount by which the two intersect changes by a requested amount.&nbsp;[‡](#m-intersection-observer) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/intersection-observer](https://www.w3.org/TR/intersection-observer/)

Interstitial
: A web page displayed before or after an expected content page, often to display advertisements or confirm the user’s age (prior to showing age-restricted material). Interstitial advertisements are usually delivered by an ad server.&nbsp;[†](#w-interstitial)

Intranet
: A computer network for sharing information, collaboration tools, operational systems, and other computing services only within an organization, and to the exclusion of access by outsiders to the organization. The term is used in contrast to public networks, such as the Internet, but uses most of the same technology. A company-wide intranet can constitute an important focal point of internal communication and collaboration, and provide a single starting point to access internal and external resources. In its simplest form, an intranet is established with the technologies for local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). Many modern intranets have search engines, user profiles, blogs, mobile apps with notifications, and events planning within their infrastructure.&nbsp;[†](#w-intranet)

Intrinsic size
: The size an element has just going by its content, with no external factors applied. For example, inline elements are sized intrinsically, with styling for width, height, and vertical margin and padding having no impact.&nbsp;[‡](#m-intrinsic-size)

Inversion of Control
: A programming principle that inverts the flow of control as compared to traditional control flow. In IoC, custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework. A software architecture with this design inverts control as compared to traditional procedural programming, where the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks. With inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.&nbsp;[†](#w-ioc)

Inverted Triangle CSS
: A CSS management approach that promotes going from generic to specific.

IPv4
: The fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP). It is one of the core protocols of standards-based inter-networking methods in the Internet and other packet-switched networks. IPv4 was the first version deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983. It still routes most Internet traffic today, despite the ongoing deployment of a successor protocol, IPv6.&nbsp;[†](#w-ipv4)

IPv6
: The most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP). IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4.&nbsp;[†](#w-ipv6)
