Identifier
: A name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique object or a unique class of objects, where the “object” or class may be an idea, physical or countable object (or class thereof), or physical or noncountable substance (or class thereof). The abbreviation ID often refers to identity, identification (the process of identifying), or an identifier (that is, an instance of identification). An identifier may be a word, number, letter, symbol, or any combination of those.&nbsp;[†](#w-id)

Iframe
: A frame placed inside the body of an HTML document, usually referring to respective `iframe` element.

Image
: An artifact that depicts visual perception, such as a photograph or other two-dimensional picture, particularly one that resembles a subject (usually a physical object). In the context of signal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s). In web development, an image often refers to an image file.&nbsp;[†](#w-image)

Image map
: A list of coordinates relating to a specific image, created in order to hyperlink areas of the image to different destinations (as opposed to a normal image link, in which the entire area of the image links to a single destination). Image maps can be created in different ways, from server-side image maps relying on the `ismap` attribute to client-side image maps using the `map` and `area` elements, or a combination of list markup and CSS styling.&nbsp;[†](#w-image-map)

Image replacement
: An early web design technique that uses Cascading Style Sheets to replace text on a web page with an image containing that text. It is intended to keep the page accessible to users of screen readers, text-only web browsers, or other browsers where support for images or style sheets is either disabled or non-existent, while allowing the image to differ between styles.&nbsp;[†](#w-image-replacement) ℹ︎&nbsp;[meiert.com/de/publications/articles/20050513](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmeiert.com%2Fde%2Fpublications%2Farticles%2F20050513%2F)

Immediately Invoked Function Expression
: A JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The IIFE is a design pattern which is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function and contains two major parts: The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator (`()`). This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope. The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression (`()`) through which the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the function.&nbsp;[‡](#m-iife)

Immutable
: A property of an object whose state cannot be modified after it was created (an immutable or unchangeable object). This is in contrast to a mutable object. In some cases, an object is considered immutable even if some internally used attributes change, but the object’s state appears unchanging from an external point of view. Strings and other concrete objects are typically expressed as immutable objects to improve readability and runtime efficiency in object-oriented programming. Immutable objects are also useful because they are inherently thread-safe.&nbsp;[†](#w-immutable)

In-App Browser
: A browser instance in a mobile application, usually working on the basis of WebViews (Android) or WKWebViews (iOS).

Increment
: A term from the Scrum framework that describes all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint, and the value of the increments of prior Sprints. An Increment must be usable and meet the definition of “Done.”

Industrial Design
: A process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured through techniques of mass production. Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product’s form and features takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication and distinguishes industrial design from craft-based design.&nbsp;[†](#w-industrial-design)

Information Architecture
: The structural design of shared information environments; the art and science of organizing and labelling websites, intranets, online communities, and software to support usability and findability; and an emerging community of practice focused on bringing principles of design, architecture, and information science to the digital landscape. Typically, IA involves a model or concept of information that is used and applied to activities which require explicit details of complex information systems. These activities include library systems and database development.&nbsp;[†](#w-ia)

Information Design
: The practice of presenting information in a way that fosters an efficient and effective understanding of the information. The term has come to be used for a specific area of graphic design related to displaying information effectively, rather than just attractively or for artistic expression. Information design is closely related to the field of data visualization. The broad applications of information design along with its close connections to other fields of design and communication practices have created some overlap in the definitions of communication design, data visualization, and information architecture.&nbsp;[†](#w-information-design)

Information Security
: The practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It is part of information risk management. It typically involves preventing or at least reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate access, use, disclosure, disruption, deletion/destruction, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or devaluation, although it may also involve reducing the adverse impacts of incidents. Information may take any form, e.g. electronic or physical, tangible (e.g. paperwork) or intangible (e.g. knowledge). Information security’s primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.&nbsp;[†](#w-infosec)

Infosec
: → Information Security

Infrastructure as Code
: The process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.&nbsp;[†](#w-iac)

Infrastructure as a Service
: Online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, or backup. A hypervisor runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to varying requirements.&nbsp;[†](#w-iaas)

Inheritance
: The mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes (sub classes) from existing ones (super class or base class) and forming them into a hierarchy of classes. In most class-based object-oriented languages, an object created through inheritance (a “child object”) acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent object (except: constructors, destructor, overloaded operators, and friend functions of the base class). Inheritance allows to create classes that are built upon existing classes, to specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface), to reuse code, and to independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces.&nbsp;[†](#w-inheritance)

Inline-level element
: An element that does not form new blocks of content and whose content is distributed in lines.

Input/Output
: The communication between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system. Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it.&nbsp;[†](#w-io)

Integrated Development Environment
: A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Some IDEs contain the necessary compiler, interpreter, or both.&nbsp;[†](#w-ide)

Intellectual Property
: A category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The most well-known types are copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation. The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is “indivisible,” since an unlimited number of people can “consume” an intellectual good without it being depleted.&nbsp;[†](#w-intellectual-property)

IntelliJ IDEA
: An integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java for developing computer software. It is developed by JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ) and was first released in 2001.&nbsp;[†](#w-intellij-idea) ℹ︎&nbsp;[jetbrains.com/idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Interaction Design
: The practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services. Beyond the digital aspect, interaction design is also useful when creating physical (non-digital) products, exploring how a user might interact with it. Common topics of interaction design include design, human-computer interaction, and software development. While interaction design has an interest in form (similar to other design fields), its main area of focus rests on behavior.&nbsp;[†](#w-ixd)

Interaction Design Association
: A member-supported organization for the field of interaction design. The IxDA was founded in 2003. ℹ︎&nbsp;[ixda.org](https://ixda.org/)

Internet
: The global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.&nbsp;[†](#w-internet)

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
: A function of ICANN that is responsible for the allocation of globally unique names and numbers that are used in Internet protocols, and for the assignment of Internet numbers which are numerical identifier assigned to an Internet resource or used in the networking protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite. Examples include IP addresses and autonomous system (AS) numbers. IANA was founded in 1988.&nbsp;[†](#w-iana) ℹ︎&nbsp;[iana.org](https://www.iana.org/)

Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
: A non-profit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network’s stable and secure operation. ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the Central Internet Address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function contract. ICANN was founded in 1998.&nbsp;[†](#w-icann) ℹ︎&nbsp;[icann.org](https://www.icann.org/)

Internet Engineering Task Force
: An open standards organization, which develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards, in particular the standards that comprise the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP). The IETF was founded in 1986.&nbsp;[†](#w-ietf) ℹ︎&nbsp;[ietf.org](https://ietf.org/)

Internet Explorer
: A series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included in the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows. The browser is discontinued, but still maintained.&nbsp;[†](#w-ie) ℹ︎&nbsp;[microsoft.com/download/internet-explorer.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer.aspx)

Internet Information Services
: An extensible web server created by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family. IIS was released in 1995.&nbsp;[†](#w-iis) ℹ︎&nbsp;[iis.net](https://www.iis.net/)

Internet Protocol
: The principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.&nbsp;[†](#w-internet-protocol)

Internet Relay Chat
: An application layer protocol that facilitates communication in the form of text. The chat process works on a client/server networking model. IRC clients are computer programs that users can install on their system or web based applications running either locally in the browser or on a 3rd party server. IRC was created in 1988 by Jarkko Oikarinen.&nbsp;[†](#w-irc)

Internet Resource Locator
: A locator defined by an Internet resource location standard.

Internet Service Provider

The ISOC’s mission is “to promote the open development, evolution and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world.”&nbsp;[†](#w-isoc) ℹ︎&nbsp;[internetsociety.org](https://www.internetsociety.org/)

Interoperability
: A characteristic of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with other products or systems, at present or in the future, in either implementation or access, without any restrictions.&nbsp;[†](#w-interoperability)

Inversion of Control
: A programming principle that inverts the flow of control as compared to traditional control flow. In IoC, custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework. A software architecture with this design inverts control as compared to traditional procedural programming, where the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks. With inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.&nbsp;[†](#w-ioc)

Inverted Triangle CSS
: A CSS management approach that promotes going from generic to specific.

IP address
: A numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.&nbsp;[†](#w-ip-address)

IPv4
: The fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP). It is one of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods in the Internet and other packet-switched networks. IPv4 was the first version deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983. It still routes most Internet traffic today, despite the ongoing deployment of a successor protocol, IPv6.&nbsp;[†](#w-ipv4)

IPv6
: The most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP). IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4.&nbsp;[†](#w-ipv6)
