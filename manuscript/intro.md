# Introduction

This is a glossary for web development.

It contains almost 2,000 important, useful, or historic terms and abbreviations relevant for web (and software) developers.

The idea of this glossary is that, while not telling a story, you can still consume it as a whole, to get a comprehensive picture at the web development landscape.

What is more, the terms in this glossary originate not only in Web Development but in Computer Science, Design, Information Security, Project Management, and other adjacent disciplines. The glossary goes beyond “just” web development. It nudges you to be curious, to acquaint yourself with the Web itself.

The explanations include pointers to specific tools and applications. These are mentioned when they have been influential in some regard, or if mentioning is of historical import. The criteria are blurry, however, and therefore tools and applications may be removed and added in later revisions. [Your feedback](https://github.com/j9t/web-development-glossary-forum/issues/new) can help make the book more valuable to fellow readers, as well as to yourself, when receiving updates.

Sometimes a term or abbreviation has several meanings. Only the tech-related ones are shown.

Sometimes there is imprecision—is a home page really a special type of web page, yet a _homepage_ just another word for a website? (Per this book, trying to gauge how “most” people use respective terms, it is.)

Many definitions and explanations are based on Wikipedia or the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN). It was not necessary, nor desirable, to come up with a new definition and explanation for every term.

Case, hyphenation, and the treatment of synonyms may be inconsistent. This reflects reality—the same concepts are sometimes called by different names, and may be written in different ways—, but is something of concern for updates to this book.

Arrows (“→”) point to the expanded forms of abbreviations, and to the more common and popular synonyms and expressions. Sometimes they take you on a little detour, but only to be transparent about the journey taken (like Personal Home Page → PHP → Hypertext Preprocessor, or HTML&nbsp;5 → HTML → HyperText Markup Language). This may seem lengthy, but is thought to make meanings, relationships, and sometimes history more clear. An arrow does not necessarily indicate equality or identity, but may point at a term that encompasses the original term, or at a related concept.

So far there are few examples. Adding examples is [a priority item](https://github.com/j9t/web-development-glossary-forum/issues/1) for future updates for this book, too.

Finally, there are certainly errors, and perhaps some controversy, too. Please [help improve the glossary](https://github.com/j9t/web-development-glossary-forum/issues/new) as well as, if applicable, Wikipedia and MDN. Trying to give back to the communities, work on the book has led to numerous small improvements to both [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jens_Meiert) and [MDN articles](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboards/revisions?user=j9t), but it is unlikely that these improvements covered all there was to improve. Thank you for giving back, too.
