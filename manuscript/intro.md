# Introduction

This is a glossary for web&nbsp;development.

It covers more than 2,000 important, useful, and historic terms and abbreviations relevant for web (and software)&nbsp;developers.

The glossary acquaints and reunites you with the major standards and concepts of the Web, with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, accessibility, security, performance, code quality, internationalization, localization, editors and tooling and more. It then goes beyond web development, touching on computer science, design, typography, usability and user experience, information as well as project management, other disciplines of interest and relevance to the modern developer. It goes beyond, inspiring the curiosity to learn more about the Web and the people creating and using&nbsp;it.

The glossary does not tell a story in the same way as other books do, but it still tells a story. It tells a story that is sterile yet messy. It tells a story that only started three decades ago and that is still unfolding. It tells a story that starts with you. Why you? Because you are at your own stage of web development—and because web development is only unfolding, only so alive, because of people like you, people who take a personal interest in it. When you read the glossary like you would read another book, you may notice. (Yet still, it is a&nbsp;glossary.)

## About the Glossary

Many explanations and definitions in this glossary are based on Wikipedia and the MDN Web Docs. It was neither necessary nor desirable to come up with a new and different explanation for every&nbsp;term.

Arrows (“→”) point to the expanded forms of abbreviations, and to the more common synonyms and expressions. Sometimes they take you on a little detour, but only to be transparent about the journey taken (like Personal Home Page → PHP → Hypertext Preprocessor, or HTML&nbsp;5 → HTML → HyperText Markup Language). This may seem lengthy, but it aims to make meanings, relationships, and sometimes history more clear. An arrow may also point at a term that encompasses the referring term, or at a related concept, and therefore does not necessarily indicate equivalence or&nbsp;identity.

Whenever there is a source of great quality or immediate use, explanations include references to external documentation and&nbsp;software.

Some terms and abbreviations have several meanings. Only the tech-related ones are&nbsp;shown.

Sometimes there is imprecision: Is a home page really a special type of web page, or is a _homepage_ just another word for a website? (Per this book, trying to gauge how “most” people use the respective terms, it&nbsp;is.)

Unfortunately, there are going to be inconsistencies, probably errors, and perhaps also controversy. Please [help improve the glossary](https://github.com/j9t/web-development-glossary-forum/issues/new) as well as, if applicable, Wikipedia and MDN Web Docs. Giving back to the communities, work on the book has led to numerous small improvements to both [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jens_Meiert) and [MDN Web Docs articles](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboards/revisions?user=j9t), but it is unlikely that these improvements covered all there was to improve. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and taking the time to contribute as&nbsp;well.
