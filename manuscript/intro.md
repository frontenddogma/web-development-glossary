# Introduction

This is a glossary for web development.

It covers almost 2,000 important, useful, and historic terms and abbreviations relevant for web (and software) developers.

The glossary connects you with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, accessibility, security, performance, usability, typography, localization, internationalization, infrastructure and tooling and much more, and then goes beyond “just” web development. The terms it contains also touch computer science, design, information and project management, even philosophy and psychology, as well as other disciplines of interest to the modern developer. With this thoroughness the glossary encourages you to stay curious, to learn more about the Web itself as well as the people using the Web. And while the glossary does not tell a story like other books would do, you can still read it as you would read other books.

## About the Glossary

Many definitions and explanations of this glossary are based on Wikipedia and the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN). It was not necessary, nor desirable, to come up with a new definition and explanation for every term.

Arrows (“→”) point to the expanded forms of abbreviations, and to the more common synonyms and expressions. Sometimes they take you on a little detour, but only to be transparent about the journey taken (like Personal Home Page → PHP → Hypertext Preprocessor, or HTML&nbsp;5 → HTML → HyperText Markup Language). This may seem lengthy, but aims to make meanings, relationships, and sometimes history more clear. An arrow may also point at a term that encompasses the referring term, or at a related concept, and therefore does not necessarily indicate equality or identity.

Whenever there is a source of great quality or immediate relevance, explanations include references to external documentation or software.

Some terms and abbreviations have several meanings. Only the tech-related ones are shown.

Sometimes there is imprecision: Is a home page really a special type of web page, yet a _homepage_ just another word for a website? (Per this book, trying to gauge how “most” people use respective terms, it is.)

Unfortunately, there are certainly inconsistencies, probably errors, and perhaps also controversy. Please [help improve the glossary](https://github.com/j9t/web-development-glossary-forum/issues/new) as well as, if applicable, Wikipedia and MDN. Trying to give back to the communities, work on the book led to numerous small improvements to both [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jens_Meiert) and [MDN articles](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboards/revisions?user=j9t), but it is unlikely that these improvements covered all there was to improve. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and taking the time to contribute as well.
