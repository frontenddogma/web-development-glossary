# Introduction

@@

The idea is that, while not telling a story, the book can indeed be read to get a solid overview over main web development terms and concepts.

Sometimes a term originates not in Web Development but in (Web) Design, Information Security, Project Management, or in another different but adjacent discipline.

[Adding examples](https://github.com/j9t/web-development-glossary/issues/1) is on the agenda as one of the next features.

## Conventions

@@

Sometimes a term or abbreviation has several meanings; only the tech-related ones may be shown.

Sometimes there’s imprecision—is a home page really a special type of web page, but a _homepage_ just another word for a website? (Per this book, trying to gauge how “most” people use the terms, it is.)

Arrows (“→”) point to the expanded forms of abbreviations, and to more common and popular synonyms and expressions. Sometimes they may take on a little tour, but just to be clear about the journey taken if there’s not much more to see (like Personal Home Page → PHP → Hypertext Preprocessor, or HTML5 → HTML 5 → HTML → HyperText Markup Language).
