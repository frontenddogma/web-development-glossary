# Introduction

This is a glossary for web development.

It covers almost 2,000 important, useful, and historic terms and abbreviations relevant for web (and software) developers.

The glossary goes beyond “just” web development. The terms it contains originate not only in Web Development but in Computer Science, Design, Information Security, Project Management, and other adjacent disciplines. It nudges you to be curious, to look beyond. It nudges you to acquaint yourself with the Web itself. And while it does not tell a story like other books would do, you can still read the glossary as you would read other books.

C> ⁂

Many definitions and explanations of this glossary are based on Wikipedia and the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN). It was not necessary, nor desirable, to come up with a new definition and explanation for every term.

Some explanations include pointers to external documentation or software. This is the case when respective documentation or software has been influential in some regard, if it proved useful, or if it is of historical import.

Some terms and abbreviations have several meanings. Only the tech-related ones are shown.

Sometimes there is imprecision: Is a home page really a special type of web page, yet a _homepage_ just another word for a website? (Per this book, trying to gauge how “most” people use respective terms, it is.)

Case, hyphenation, and the treatment of synonyms may be inconsistent. This reflects reality, for terms may be written in different ways, and the same concepts are sometimes called by different names.

Arrows (“→”) point to the expanded forms of abbreviations, and to the more common synonyms and expressions. Sometimes they take you on a little detour, but only to be transparent about the journey taken (like Personal Home Page → PHP → Hypertext Preprocessor, or HTML&nbsp;5 → HTML → HyperText Markup Language). This may seem lengthy, but aims to make meanings, relationships, and sometimes history more clear. An arrow may also point at a term that encompasses the referring term, or at a related concept, and therefore does not necessarily indicate equality or identity.

Finally, and unfortunately, there are certainly errors, and perhaps also controversy. Please [help improve the glossary](https://github.com/j9t/web-development-glossary-forum/issues/new) as well as, if applicable, Wikipedia and MDN. Trying to give back to the communities, work on the book led to numerous small improvements to both [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jens_Meiert) and [MDN articles](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboards/revisions?user=j9t), but it is unlikely that these improvements covered all there was to improve. Thank you for contributing as well.
