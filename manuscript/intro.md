# Introduction

@@

The idea is that, while not telling a story, the book can indeed be read to get a solid overview over main web development terms and concepts. The glossary covers some basics.

The Glossary is very lightly opinionated.

Sometimes a term originates not in Web Development but in Computer Science, Information Security, (Web) Design, Project Management, or in another different but adjacent discipline. The glossary goes beyond “just” web development.

Case, hyphenation, treatment of synonyms may be inconsistent. That reflects reality but is of concern for future updates of the book. [Adding examples](https://github.com/j9t/web-development-glossary-forum/issues/1) is also on the agenda.

There are certainly errors and controversy! Please [help improve the glossary](https://github.com/j9t/web-development-glossary-forum/issues/new) and also, if applicable, Wikipedia and MDN. (Work on the book has already led to numerous small improvements to both [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jens_Meiert) and [MDN articles](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboards/revisions?user=j9t).)

## Conventions

@@

Sometimes a term or abbreviation has several meanings; only the tech-related ones may be shown.

Sometimes there’s imprecision—is a home page really a special type of web page, but a _homepage_ just another word for a website? (Per this book, trying to gauge how “most” people use the terms, it is.)

Arrows (“→”) point to the expanded forms of abbreviations, and to more common and popular synonyms and expressions. Sometimes they may take on a little tour, but just to be clear about the journey taken if there’s not much more to see (like Personal Home Page → PHP → Hypertext Preprocessor, or HTML&nbsp;5 → HTML → HyperText Markup Language). This may seem lengthy, but is thought to make meanings, relationships, and sometimes history more clear. An arrow does not always indicated equality or identity, but may also point at closely related concept or a term that also covers the originating term.
