# Introduction

The idea is that, while not telling a story, the book can indeed be read to get a solid overview over main web development terms and concepts.

Sometimes a term or abbreviation has several meanings; only the tech-related ones may be shown.

Sometimes a term originates not in Web Development but in (Web) Design, Information Security, Project Management, or in another different but adjacent discipline.

Sometimes there’s imprecision—is a home page really a special type of web page, but a _homepage_ just another word for a website? (Per this book, trying to gauge how “most” people use the terms, it is.)

[Adding examples](https://github.com/j9t/web-development-glossary/issues/1) is on the agenda as one of the next features.
