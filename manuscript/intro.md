The idea is that, while not telling a story, the book can indeed be read to get a solid overview over main web development terms and concepts.

Sometimes a term or abbreviation has several meanings; only the tech-related ones may be shown.

Sometimes a term originates not in Web Development but in (Web) Design, Information Security, Project Management, or in another different but adjacent discipline.
