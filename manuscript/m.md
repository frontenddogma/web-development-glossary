MAC address
: A unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network model, MAC addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer of the data link layer. As typically represented, MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator. MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers.&nbsp;[†](#w-mac-address)

Mac OS
: → macOS

Machine Learning
: The scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as “training data,” in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a conventional algorithm for effectively performing the task. Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers.&nbsp;[†](#w-ml)

macOS
: A series of proprietary graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple since 2001. macOS is the primary operating system for Apple’s Mac computers. Within the market of desktop, laptop, and home computers, and by web usage, it is the second most widely used desktop OS after Microsoft Windows. macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems. The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS, which was introduced in 1984, and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999. The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released in March 2001, with its first update, 10.1, arriving later that year. macOS is based on the Unix operating system.&nbsp;[†](#w-macos) ℹ︎&nbsp;[apple.com/macos](https://www.apple.com/macos/)

macOS, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python
: A solution stack composed of free and open source software running with proprietary commercial software, to serve dynamic websites on computers running macOS. MAMP can be used to develop websites that use popular current technologies, on a stand-alone desktop or laptop computer without the need for a separate web server. The name “MAMP” is an acronym representing the original components of the system: macOS, the operating system; Apache, the web server; MySQL, the database management system; and PHP, Perl, or Python, programming languages used for web development. MAMP is not limited to these choices of components, however; NGINX can be used in place of Apache, for example.&nbsp;[†](#w-mamp)

Macromedia Flash

MacWWW
: An early minimalist web browser from 1992 meant to run on Macintosh computers. It was the first web browser for the classic Mac OS platform, and the first for any non-Unix operating system. MacWWW tries to emulate the design of WorldWideWeb. Unlike modern browsers it opens each link in a new window only after a double-click.&nbsp;[†](#w-macwww)

Magic code
: An informal term for abstraction, used to describe code that handles complex tasks while hiding the respective complexity to present a simple interface. The term is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, and often carries bad connotations, implying that the true behavior of the code is not immediately apparent.&nbsp;[†](#w-magic)

Main thread
: The thread on which a browser processes user events and paints. By default, the browser uses a single thread to run all the JavaScript on a page, as well as to perform layout, reflows, and garbage collection. This single thread is why long-running JavaScript functions can block the thread, leading to an unresponsive page and a bad user experience.&nbsp;[‡](#m-main-thread)

Maintainability
: The ease with which a product can be maintained in order to correct defects or their cause, repair or replace faulty or worn-out components without having to replace still working parts, prevent unexpected working conditions, maximize a product’s useful life, maximize efficiency, reliability, and safety, meet new requirements, make future maintenance easier, or cope with a changed environment.&nbsp;[†](#w-maintainability)

Maintenance
: The functional checking, servicing, repairing, or replacing of necessary devices, equipment, machinery, building infrastructure, supporting utilities, and also software in industrial, business, governmental, and residential installations. Over time, maintenance has come to include multiple wordings that describe various cost-effective practices to keep equipment operational; these activities take place either before or after a failure.&nbsp;[†](#w-maintenance)

Makefile
: A file (named “Makefile” by default) containing a set of directives used by a make build automation tool to generate a target. A makefile works upon the principle that files only need recreating if their dependencies are newer than the file being created. The makefile is recursively carried out until everything has been updated and the ultimate target is complete.&nbsp;[†](#w-makefile)

Man-in-the-middle attack
: An attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other. One example of a MITM attack is active eavesdropping, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker.&nbsp;[†](#w-mitm) 

Margin
: Per the CSS box model, the margin area of a box, that is, an element of a document. The margin area lies outside the border area of a box.

Margin collapsing
: The joining of two adjacent vertical margins in the same block formatting context. In many cases margins are adjoining and do collapse, but there are exceptions, as when margins of the root element are concerned.

Markdown
: A lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format README files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain-text editor. Markdown was first released in 2004.&nbsp;[†](#w-markdown) ℹ︎&nbsp;[is.gd/bkp5lM](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Marketing
: The study and management of exchange relationships. Marketing is the business process of creating relationships with and satisfying customers. Because marketing is used to attract customers, it is one of the primary components of business management and commerce. Marketers can direct product to other businesses (B2B marketing) or directly to consumers (B2C marketing).&nbsp;[†](#w-marketing)

Markup
: → Markup language

Markup language
: A system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The idea and terminology evolved from the “marking up” of paper manuscripts (i.e., the revision instructions by editors), which is traditionally written with a red or blue pencil on authors’ manuscripts. In digital media, this “blue pencil instruction text” was replaced by tags, which indicate what the parts of the document are, rather than the details of how they might be shown on some display. This lets authors avoid formatting every instance of the same kind of thing redundantly (and possibly inconsistently). It also avoids the specification of fonts and dimensions which may not apply to many users (such as those with different-size displays, impaired vision, and screen-reading software). Some markup languages, such as the widely used HTML, have pre-defined presentation semantics. Others, such as XML and its predecessor SGML, allow but do not impose such prescriptions—all the while allowing users to define any custom document components as they wish.&nbsp;[†](#w-markup-language)

Massively Parallel Processing
: The use of a large number of computer processors (or separate computers) to simultaneously perform a set of coordinated computations in parallel. One approach for MPP is grid computing, where the processing power of many computers in distributed domains is opportunistically used whenever a computer is available. Another approach is grouping many processors in close proximity to each other, as in a computer cluster.&nbsp;[†](#w-mpp)

Masthead
: A publication’s masthead is a printed list, published in a fixed position in each edition, of its owners, departments, officers, contributors, and address details, which in British English usage is known as imprint. In the UK and other Commonwealth nations, the masthead is a publication’s designed title as it appears on the front page, which in American English is known as the nameplate or “flag.”&nbsp;[†](#w-masthead)

Material Design
: A design language, developed in 2014 by Google. Expanding on the “card” motifs that debuted in Google Now, Material Design uses more grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.&nbsp;[†](#w-material-design) ℹ︎&nbsp;[material.io/design](https://material.io/design/)

Mathematical markup language
: A computer notation for representing mathematical formulae, based on mathematical notation. Specialized markup languages are necessary because computers normally deal with linear text and more limited character sets (although increasing support for Unicode is obsoleting simple uses). A formally standardized syntax also allows a computer to interpret otherwise ambiguous content, for rendering or even evaluating. For computer-interpretable syntaxes, the most popular are TeX/LaTeX and MathML.&nbsp;[†](#w-mathematical-markup-language)

Mathematical Markup Language
: An application of XML for describing mathematical notations and capturing both its structure and content. MathML aims at integrating mathematical formulae into World Wide Web pages and other documents. It is part of HTML and an ISO standard ISO/IEC DIS 40314 since 2015.&nbsp;[†](#w-mathml) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/Math](https://www.w3.org/Math/)

Maven
: A build automation tool primarily used for Java projects that can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. The Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation, where it was formerly part of the Jakarta Project. It was first released in 2004.&nbsp;[†](#w-maven) ℹ︎&nbsp;[maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org/)

MD
: → Markdown

MD2
: A cryptographic hash function developed in 1989 by Ronald Rivest, whose initialism “MD” stands for “Message Digest.” The algorithm is optimized for 8-bit computers. MD2 is specified in RFC&nbsp;1319 and no longer considered secure.&nbsp;[†](#w-md2)

MD4
: A cryptographic hash function developed in 1990 by Ronald Rivest. The digest length is 128 bits. The algorithm has influenced later designs, such as the MD5, SHA-1, and RIPEMD algorithms. The security of MD4 has been severely compromised.&nbsp;[†](#w-md4)

MD5
: A widely used hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption. It remains suitable for other non-cryptographic purposes, for example for determining the partition for a particular key in a partitioned database. MD5 was designed in 1991 by Ronald Rivest to replace the earlier hash function MD4, and was specified in 1992 as RFC&nbsp;1321.&nbsp;[†](#w-md5)

MD6
: A cryptographic hash function. It uses a Merkle tree-like structure to allow for immense parallel computation of hashes for long inputs. Authors claim a performance of 28 cycles per byte for MD6-256 on an Intel Core 2 Duo and provable resistance against differential cryptanalysis.&nbsp;[†](#w-md6)

MEAN
: A JavaScript software stack for building dynamic websites and applications. The MEAN stack is MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js. Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can be written in one language for both client- and server-side execution environments. The “MEAN” acronym was coined in 2013.&nbsp;[†](#w-mean)

Media
: The communication outlets or tools used to store and deliver information or data.

Media Asset Management
: A special type of Digital Asset Management (DAM) that helps to organize media like images, audio, and video.

Media query
: A CSS specification allowing content rendering to adapt to conditions such as screen resolution (e.g., smartphone screen vs. computer screen) by so-called `@media` rules. _Media Queries_ became a W3C recommended standard in 2012 and is a cornerstone of responsive web design (RWD).&nbsp;[†](#w-media-query) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/)

Medium integer
: An integral data type of 24 bits, with a signed range from –8,388,608 to 8,388,607, and an unsigned range from 0 to 16,777,215.

Mega menu
: A particularly large and structured (for example, using several columns) type of navigation menu.

Memoization
: An optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Memoization has also been used in other contexts (and for purposes other than speed gains), such as in simple mutually recursive descent parsing. Although related to caching, memoization refers to a specific case of this optimization, distinguishing it from forms of caching such as buffering or page replacement. In the context of some logic programming languages, memoization is also known as tabling.&nbsp;[†](#w-memoization)

Menu
: A list of options or commands presented to the user of a computer or communications system. A menu may either be a system’s entire user interface, or only part of a more complex one.&nbsp;[†](#w-menu)

Merge request
: A request to merge a version-controlled branch into another branch.

Merging
: A fundamental operation that reconciles multiple changes made to a version-controlled collection of files. Most often, merging is necessary when a file is modified on two independent branches and then brought together. The result is a single collection of files that contains both sets of changes. In some cases, the merge can be performed automatically, because there is sufficient history information to reconstruct the changes, and the changes do not conflict. In other cases, a person must decide exactly what the resulting files should contain. Many version control software tools include merge capabilities.&nbsp;[†](#w-merging)

Message Authentication Code
: A short piece of information used to authenticate a message, that is, to confirm that the message came from the stated sender (its authenticity) and has not been changed. The MAC value protects a message’s data integrity, as well as its authenticity, by allowing verifiers (who also possess the secret key) to detect any changes to the message content.&nbsp;[†](#w-mac)

Meta element
: An HTML element that can provide structured metadata about a web page. Meta elements are part of a web page’s `head` section. Multiple meta elements with different attributes can be used on the same page. Meta elements can be used to specify a page’s description, keywords, and other metadata. The HTML `meta` element has two uses: to emulate the use of an HTTP response header field, and to embed additional metadata within the HTML document.&nbsp;[†](#w-meta-element)

Metadata
: Data that provides information about other data, or data about data. There are many distinct types of metadata, including descriptive, structural, administrative, reference, and statistical metadata.&nbsp;[†](#w-metadata)

Metadata content
: Content that sets up the presentation or behavior of the rest of the content, or that sets up the relationship of a document with other documents, or that conveys other “out of band” information. Metadata content is marked up through the `base`, `link`, `meta`, `noscript`, `script`, `style`, `template`, and `title` elements.&nbsp;§

Method
: A procedure associated with a message and an object. An object consists of data and behavior. The data and behavior comprise an interface, which specifies how the object may be utilized by any of various consumers of the object. Data is represented as properties of the object and behaviors are represented as methods of the object. For example, a `Window` object could have methods such as `open` and `close`, while its state (whether it is opened or closed at any given point in time) would be a property. In class-based programming, methods are defined in a class, and objects are instances of a given class.&nbsp;[†](#w-method)

Microformat
: An approach to semantic markup which uses HTML elements supported for other purposes to convey additional metadata and other attributes in web pages and other contexts that support HTML, such as RSS. The approach allows software to process information intended for end users (such as contact information, geographic coordinates, calendar events, and similar information) automatically. Although the content of web pages has been capable of some “automated processing” since the inception of the Web, such processing is difficult because the markup elements used to display information on the Web do not describe what the information means. Microformats can bridge this gap by attaching semantics, and thereby obviate other, more complicated, methods of automated processing, such as natural language processing or screen scraping.&nbsp;[†](#w-microformat) ℹ︎&nbsp;[microformats.org](http://microformats.org/)

Microservice
: A service that is small in size, messaging-enabled, bounded by contexts, autonomously developed, independently deployable, decentralized, and built and released with automated processes.&nbsp;[†](#w-msa)

Microservice architecture
: A variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style that arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.&nbsp;[†](#w-msa)

Microsite
: An individual web page or a small cluster of pages which are meant to function as a discrete entity within an existing website, or to complement an offline activity. The microsite’s main page can have its own domain or subdomain.&nbsp;[†](#w-microsite)

Microsoft Active Accessibility
: An API for user interface accessibility. MSAA was introduced in 1997 as a platform add-on to Microsoft Windows&nbsp;95. MSAA is designed to help assistive technology products interact with standard and custom user interface elements of an application (or the operating system), as well as to access, identify, and manipulate an application’s UI elements.&nbsp;[†](#w-msaa)

Microsoft Design Language
: A design language created by Microsoft. MDL is focused on typography and simplified icons, absence of clutter, increased content to chrome ratio (“content before chrome”), and basic geometric shapes. Early examples of MDL principles can be found in Encarta 95 and MSN 2.0. The design language evolved in Windows Media Center and Zune and was formally introduced as Metro during the unveiling of Windows Phone 7. It has since been incorporated into several of the company’s other products, including the Xbox 360 system software, Xbox One, Windows&nbsp;8, Windows Phone, and Outlook.&nbsp;[†](#w-mdl)

Microtask
: A task to be run after a currently executed script. Microtasks are run in order, and include promise callbacks, intersection observer callbacks, and mutation observer callbacks.

Middleware
: Computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. It can be described as “software glue.” Middleware makes it easier for software developers to implement communication and input/output, so they can focus on the specific purpose of their application. It gained popularity in the 1980s as a solution to the problem of how to link newer applications to older legacy systems, although the term had been in use since 1968.&nbsp;[†](#w-middleware)

MIME sniffing
: The practice of inspecting the content of a byte stream to attempt to deduce the file format of the data within it. MIME sniffing is generally used to compensate for a lack of accurate metadata that would otherwise be required to enable the file to be interpreted correctly. MIME and content sniffing techniques tend to use a mixture of techniques that rely on redundancy found in most file formats.&nbsp;[†](#w-mime-sniffing)

MIME type
: A two-part identifier for file formats and format contents transmitted on the Internet, like `text/plain`. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the official authority for the standardization and publication of these classifications. Media types were originally defined in 1996 in Request for Comments 2045 as a part of MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) specification, for denoting type of email message content and attachments.&nbsp;[†](#w-mime-type)

Mini Program
: A sub-application for the WeChat messaging, social media, and payment app. Mini Programs are developed using a framework consisting of the WeiXin Markup Language (WXML), WeiXin Style Sheets (WXSS), and WeiXin Script (WXS). ℹ︎&nbsp;[bit.ly/38buLwe](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/framework/)

Minification
: The process of removing all unnecessary characters from the source code of interpreted programming languages or markup languages without changing their functionality. These unnecessary characters usually include white space characters, new line characters, comments, and sometimes block delimiters, which are used to add readability to the code but are not required for it to execute. Minification reduces the size of the source code, making its transmission over a network (e.g., the Internet) more efficient.&nbsp;[†](#w-minification)

Minifier
: A software that removes all unnecessary characters from markup, style sheets, scripts, and other source code.

Minimum Viable Product
: A version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. Gathering insights from an MVP is often less expensive than developing a product with more features, which increases costs and risk if the product fails.&nbsp;[†](#w-mvp)

MIP

MITM
: → Man-in-the-middle attack

Mixin
: A class that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. How those other classes gain access to the mixin’s methods depends on the language. Mixins are sometimes described as being “included” rather than “inherited.” Mixins encourage code reuse and can be used to avoid the inheritance ambiguity that multiple inheritance can cause, or to work around lack of support for multiple inheritance in a language. A mixin can also be viewed as an interface with implemented methods. This pattern is an example of enforcing the Dependency Inversion Principle.&nbsp;[†](#w-mixin)

Mobile
: In computing, human-computer interaction in which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage, which allows for transmission of data, voice, and video. Mobile computing involves mobile communication, mobile hardware, and mobile software. Communication includes _ad hoc_ networks and infrastructure networks as well as communication properties, protocols, data formats, and concrete technologies.&nbsp;[†](#w-mobile)

Mobile First
: A form of progressive enhancement and an approach to web development and web design that focuses on prioritizing design and development for mobile screen sizes over design and development for desktop screen sizes. The rationale behind the mobile-first approach is to provide users with good user experiences at all screen sizes—by starting with creating a user experience that works well on small screens, and then building on top of that to further enrich the user experience as the screen size increases. The mobile-first approach contrasts with the older approach of designing for desktop screen sizes first, and then only later adding some support for small screen sizes.&nbsp;[‡](#m-mobile-first)

Mobile Instant Pages
: A mobile-centered web development and publishing framework similar to Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). MIP was released in 2016 by Baidu. ℹ︎&nbsp;[mipengine.org](https://www.mipengine.org/)

Mobilegeddon
: A name for Google’s search engine algorithm update of April 21, 2015. The term “Mobilegeddon” was coined by Chuck Price in a post written for _Search Engine Watch_ on March 9, 2015, and then adopted by webmasters and web developers. The main effect of the update was to give priority to websites that display well on smartphones and other mobile devices. The change did not affect searches made from a desktop computer or a laptop.&nbsp;[†](#w-mobilegeddon)

Mocha
: → JavaScript

Modal
: A graphical control element subordinate to an application’s main window. It creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible, with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Users must interact with the modal window before they can return to the parent application. This avoids interrupting the workflow on the main window. Modal windows are sometimes called heavy windows or modal dialogs because they often display a dialog box.&nbsp;[†](#w-modal)

Model-View-Controller
: A software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern has become popular for designing web applications. Popular programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, C#, and Swift have MVC frameworks that are used for web or mobile application development straight out of the box.&nbsp;[†](#w-mvc)

Model-View-Viewmodel
: A software architectural pattern. MVVM facilitates a separation of the development of the graphical user interface, be it via a markup language or GUI code, from the development of the business logic or backend logic (the data model). The view model of MVVM is a value converter, meaning the view model is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented.&nbsp;[†](#w-mvvm)

Modernizr
: A JavaScript library that detects the features available in a user’s browser. This lets web pages avoid unsupported features by informing the user their browser is not supported or loading a polyfill. Modernizr aims to provide feature detection in a consistent and easy to use manner that discourages the use of failure-prone browser sniffing. Modernizr was first released in 2009.&nbsp;[†](#w-modernizr) ℹ︎&nbsp;[modernizr.com](https://modernizr.com/)

Monolith
: A single-tiered software application in which the user interface and data access code are combined into a single program from a single platform. A monolithic application is self-contained, and independent from other computing applications. In its original use, the term “monolithic” described enormous mainframe applications with no usable modularity. This, in combination with rapid increase in computational power and therefore rapid increase in the complexity of the problems which could be tackled by software, resulted in unmaintainable systems and the “software crisis.”&nbsp;[†](#w-monolith)

Mosaic
: The web browser that popularized the World Wide Web and the Internet. Mosaic was also a client for earlier Internet protocols such as File Transfer Protocol, Network News Transfer Protocol, and Gopher. The browser was named for its support of multiple Internet protocols. Its intuitive interface, reliability, Microsoft Windows port, and simple installation all contributed to its popularity within the Web, as well as on Microsoft operating systems. Mosaic was also the first browser to display images inline with text instead of displaying them in a separate window. It is often described as the first graphical web browser, though it was preceded by WorldWideWeb, the lesser-known Erwise, and ViolaWWW. Mosaic was first released in 1991.&nbsp;[†](#w-mosaic)

Multi-factor authentication
: An authentication method in which a computer user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism: knowledge (something the user and only the user knows), possession (something the user and only the user has), and inherence (something the user and only the user is).&nbsp;[†](#w-mfa)

Multimedia
: Content that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, video, and interactive content. Multimedia contrasts with media that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material. Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by information content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance.&nbsp;[†](#w-multimedia)

Multiple inheritance
: A feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class. It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object or class may only inherit from one particular object or class. Multiple inheritance has been a sensitive issue for many years, with opponents pointing to its increased complexity and ambiguity in situations such as the “diamond problem,” where it may be ambiguous as to which parent class a particular feature is inherited from if more than one parent class implements said feature. This can be addressed in various ways, including using virtual inheritance.&nbsp;[†](#w-multiple-inheritance)

Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
: An Internet standard that extends the format of email messages to support text in character sets other than ASCII, as well as attachments of audio, video, images, and application programs. Message bodies may consist of multiple parts, and header information may be specified in non-ASCII character sets. Email messages with MIME formatting are typically transmitted with standard protocols, such as the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the Post Office Protocol (POP), and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).&nbsp;[†](#w-mime)

Muphry’s Law

Murphy’s Law
: An adage or epigram that is typically stated as: “Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.”&nbsp;[†](#w-murphys-law)

Mustache
: A web template system. Mustache is described as a “logic-less” system because it lacks any explicit control flow statements, like `if` and `else` conditionals or `for` loops; however, both looping and conditional evaluation can be achieved using section tags processing lists and lambdas. It is named “Mustache” because of the heavy use of curly brackets, which resemble a sideways moustache. Mustache is used mainly for mobile and web applications.&nbsp;[†](#w-mustache) ℹ︎&nbsp;[mustache.github.io](https://mustache.github.io/)

Mutual authentication
: The mutual authenticating of two parties at the same time, in an authentication protocol. Mutual authentication is a default mode of authentication in some protocols (IKE, SSH) and optional in others (TLS). Mutual authentication is desired in verification schemes that transmit sensitive data, in order to ensure data security. It can be accomplished with two types of credentials: usernames and passwords, and public key certificates.&nbsp;[†](#w-mutual-authentication)

Mutual TLS authentication
: Mutual authentication including client-to-server authentication using client-side X.509 certificates. mTLS is more often used in business-to-business (B2B) applications, where a limited number of programmatic and homogeneous clients are connecting to specific web services, the operational burden is limited, and security requirements are usually higher as compared to consumer environments.&nbsp;[†](#w-mutual-authentication)
