Jakob’s Law
: “Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.” ℹ︎&nbsp;[nngroup.com/articles/end-of-web-design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/end-of-web-design/)

JAMStack
: A solution stack based on JavaScript, APIs, and markup (“JAM”).

Jank
: A sluggishness in a user interface, usually caused by executing long tasks on the main thread, blocking rendering, or expending too much processor power on background processes.&nbsp;[‡](#m-jank)

Java
: A general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers “write once, run anywhere” (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. Java was first released in 1995.&nbsp;[†](#w-java) ℹ︎&nbsp;[java.com](https://www.java.com/)

Java servlet
: A Java software component that extends the capabilities of a server. Although servlets can respond to many types of requests, they most commonly implement web containers for hosting web applications on web servers and thus qualify as a server-side servlet web API.&nbsp;[†](#w-java-servlet)

JavaScript
: → ECMAScript

JavaScript Object Notation
: An open-standard file format or language-independent data interchange format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). It is a very common data format, with a diverse range of applications, such as serving as replacement for XML in AJAX systems. The Internet media type for JSON is `application/json`.&nbsp;[†](#w-json) ℹ︎&nbsp;[json.org](https://www.json.org/)

JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data
: A method of encoding Linked Data using JSON. JSON-LD allows data to be serialized in a way that is similar to traditional JSON. It was initially developed by the JSON for Linking Data Community Group.&nbsp;[†](#w-json-ld) ℹ︎&nbsp;[json-ld.org](https://json-ld.org/)

JavaServer Pages
: A collection of technologies that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, SOAP, and other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, JSP is similar to PHP and ASP, but uses the Java programming language. To deploy and run JavaServer Pages, a compatible web server with a servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty, is required.&nbsp;[†](#w-jsp)

Jetty
: A Java HTTP (Web) server and Java Servlet container. While Web Servers are usually associated with serving documents to people, Jetty is often used for machine to machine communications, usually within larger software frameworks. Jetty is developed as a free and open source project as part of the Eclipse Foundation. Jetty was first released in 1995.&nbsp;[†](#w-jetty) ℹ︎&nbsp;[eclipse.org/jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) 

Joint Photographic Experts Group
: The joint committee between ISO/IEC JTC 1 and ITU-T (formerly CCITT) that created and maintains the JPEG, JPEG 2000, and JPEG XR standards.&nbsp;[†](#w-joint-photographic-experts-group) ℹ︎&nbsp;[jpeg.org](https://jpeg.org/)

JPEG
: A commonly used method of lossy compression and a file format for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality. Since its introduction in 1992, JPEG has been the most widely used image compression standard in the world, and the most widely used digital image format, with several billion JPEG images produced every day as of 2015.&nbsp;[†](#w-jpeg)

JScript
: A dialect of the ECMAScript standard that is used in Microsoft's Internet Explorer. JScript is implemented as an Active Scripting engine. JScript was developed by Microsoft and first supported in the Internet Explorer 3.0 browser released in 1996. Its most recent version is JScript 9.0, included in Internet Explorer 9.&nbsp;[†](#w-jscript)

JSON Web Token
: An Internet standard for creating JSON-based access tokens that assert some number of claims. JWT claims can be typically used to pass identity of authenticated users between an identity provider and a service provider, or any other type of claims as required by business processes.&nbsp;[†](#w-jwt)
