Jakob’s Law
: “Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.” ℹ︎&nbsp;[nngroup.com/articles/end-of-web-design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/end-of-web-design/)

JAMStack

Jank
: A sluggishness in a user interface, usually caused by executing long tasks on the main thread, blocking rendering, or expending too much processor power on background processes.&nbsp;[‡](#m-jank)

Java
: A general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers “write once, run anywhere” (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. Java was first released in 1995.&nbsp;[†](#w-java) ℹ︎&nbsp;[java.com](https://www.java.com/)
