Cache
: A hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere. A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot. Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cache)

Callback
: Executable code that is provided as an argument to other code that executes‚Äîcalls back‚Äîthat argument immediately (synchronous callback) or at a later time (asynchronous callback).&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-callback)

Canvas
: A container, the HTML `canvas` element, that allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D and 3D shapes and bitmap images by providing an empty graphic zone on which specific JavaScript APIs can draw (such as Canvas 2D or WebGL).&nbsp;[‚Ä°](#m-canvas)

Card sorting
: A method that aids the design or evaluation of the information architecture of a website. Card sorting is usually performed with groups, with attendees organizing topics into categories or folksonomies.

Caret
: A grapheme‚Äî‚Äú^‚Äù, ‚Äú‚Ä∏‚Äù, ‚Äú‚ÅÅ‚Äù, or ‚ÄúÔºæ‚Äù‚Äîwith several uses, including as a proofreading mark, as a special character in programming languages, as an escape character, or for estimation.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-caret)

Cascading Style Sheets
: A style sheet language that allows to manage the presentation of markup languages like HTML or XML. The first final specification of CSS was published in 1996 by H√•kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos. üåç&nbsp;[w3.org/Style/CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)

Case
: In engineering, as _use_ case, a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role (known in UML as an actor) and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or other external system. In systems engineering, use cases are used at a higher level than within software engineering, often representing missions or stakeholder goals.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-case-engineering)
: In programming, a selection mechanism to allow a variable to change the flow of a program.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-case-programming)
: In typography, as _letter_ case, the distinction between the letters that are in larger upper case (also uppercase, capital letters, capitals, caps, large letters, or more formally majuscule) and smaller lower case (also lowercase, small letters, or more formally minuscule) in the written representation of certain languages.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-case-typography)

Certificate
: An electronic document used to prove the ownership of a public key. The certificate includes information about the key, information about the identity of its owner (called the subject), and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate‚Äôs contents (called the issuer).&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-certificate) 

Character
: An encoded symbol that maps to a glyph.

Character encoding

Chrome
: A cross-platform web browser. Chrome was released in 2008 by Google. üåç&nbsp;[google.com/chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
: The graphical elements of a web browser, like title, address, and status bar as well as navigation elements.

Cipher
: An algorithm for encryption or decryption. To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cipher)

Class
: An extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default constructor of the class (a subroutine that creates objects), and as the type of objects generated by instantiating the class.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-class)
: In web development, the (value of the) `class` attribute, usually used as a selector for styling purposes. 

CLI
: ‚Üí Command-Line Interface

Click
: A physical or emulated interaction with a pointing device.

Clickthrough Rate
: The ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-ctr)

Client
: A piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server. The server is often (but not always) on another computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of a network.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-client)

Client Hints
: A set of HTTP request header fields for proactive content negotiation allowing clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences. Client Hints enable automated delivery of optimized assets like the automatic negotiation of image DPR resolution.&nbsp;[‚Ä°](#m-client-hints) 

Client side
: Operations on the client as opposed to the server side in a client-server relationship.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-client-side) 

Closure
: A technique for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions. Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function together with an environment. The environment is a mapping associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created. Unlike a plain function, a closure allows the function to access those captured variables through the closure‚Äôs copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-closure)

CMS
: ‚Üí Content Management System

Coalescing
: The merging of two adjacent free blocks of memory, which is relevant as when an application frees memory, gaps can fall in the memory segment that the application uses.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-coalescing)
: A way to provide a default value if an operand is `null` or `undefined`. This so-called null or nullish coalescing allows a default value to be defined for cases where a more specific value is not available.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-coalescing-operator)

Chaining
: The calling of several methods after another on an object.

Code
: The set of instructions forming a computer program which is executed by a computer. It is one of two components of the software which runs on computer hardware, the other being the data.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-code)

Code point
: Any of the numerical values that make up the code space for a character encoding. Many code points represent single characters but they can also have other meanings, such as for formatting.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-code-point)

Code splitting
: The splitting of code into various bundles or components which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. While the total amount of code is the same (and perhaps even a few bytes larger), the amount of code needed during initial load can be reduced.&nbsp;[‚Ä°](#m-code-splitting)

Color blindness
: The decreased ability to see color or differences in color. 8% of men and 0.5% of women have some form of color blindness. The most common forms of color blindness are deuteranomaly, deuteranopia, protanomaly, and protanopia.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-color-blindness)

Command-Line Interface
: An interface processing commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. Operating systems implement command-line interfaces in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cli)

Comment
: A developer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. Comments are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters. The syntax of comments in various programming languages varies considerably.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-comment)

Compatibility
: The ability of software to run on a particular architecture or operating system, and the ability of hardware to work with a particular CPU architecture, bus, motherboard, or operating system. Compatible software and hardware may not always run at its highest stated performance.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-compatibility)

Compatibility mode
: A software mechanism in which a software either emulates an older version of software, or mimics another operating system in order to allow older or incompatible software or files to remain compatible with the computer‚Äôs newer hardware or software. Examples of the software using the mode are operating systems and Internet Explorer.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-compatibility-mode)

Compiling
: Translating computer code written in one programming language into another language.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-compiler)

Compiler
: A computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-compiler)

Compression
: The process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Any particular compression is either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred to as an encoder, and one that performs the reversal of the process (decompression) as a decoder.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-compression)

Concurrent Versioning System
: ‚Üí Concurrent Versions System

Concurrent Versions System
: A free client-server revision control system. CVS was developed in 1986 by Dick Grune.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cvs) üåç&nbsp;[savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs)

Conditional
: A set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is completed or not. An instruction or a set of instructions is executed, if a specific condition is fulfilled. Otherwise, another instruction is executed. It is also possible to repeat the execution of an instruction, or set of instructions, while a condition is not yet fulfilled.&nbsp;[‚Ä°](#m-conditional)
