Cache
: A hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere. A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot. Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cache)

Call to Action
: A marketing term used extensively in advertising and selling. It refers to any device designed to prompt an immediate response or encourage an immediate sale. A CTA most often refers to the use of words or phrases that can be incorporated into sales scripts, advertising messages or web pages that encourage consumers to take prompt action.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cta)

Callback
: Executable code that is provided as an argument to other code that executes‚Äîcalls back‚Äîthat argument immediately (synchronous callback) or at a later time (asynchronous callback).&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-callback)

Canvas
: A container, the HTML `canvas` element, that allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D and 3D shapes and bitmap images by providing an empty graphic zone on which specific JavaScript APIs can draw (such as Canvas 2D or WebGL).&nbsp;[‚Ä°](#m-canvas)

Card sorting
: A method that aids the design or evaluation of the information architecture of a website. Card sorting is usually performed with groups, with attendees organizing topics into categories or folksonomies.

Caret
: A grapheme‚Äî‚Äú^‚Äù, ‚Äú‚Ä∏‚Äù, ‚Äú‚ÅÅ‚Äù, or ‚ÄúÔºæ‚Äù‚Äîwith several uses, including as a proofreading mark, as a special character in programming languages, as an escape character, or for estimation.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-caret)

Cascading Style Sheets

Case
: In engineering, as _use_ case, a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role (known in UML as an actor) and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or other external system. In systems engineering, use cases are used at a higher level than within software engineering, often representing missions or stakeholder goals.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-case-engineering)
: In programming, a selection mechanism to allow a variable to change the flow of a program.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-case-programming)
: In typography, as _letter_ case, the distinction between the letters that are in larger upper case (also uppercase, capital letters, capitals, caps, large letters, or more formally majuscule) and smaller lower case (also lowercase, small letters, or more formally minuscule) in the written representation of certain languages.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-case-typography)

Character
: An encoded symbol that maps to a glyph.

Character encoding
: A mapping of code points to characters, like UTF-8.

Character entity reference
: A character reference that refers to a character by the name of an entity which has the desired character as its replacement text. The entity must either be predefined (built into the markup language) or explicitly declared in a Document Type Definition (DTD). The format is the same as for any entity reference: `&name;`, where ‚Äúname‚Äù is the case-sensitive name of the entity.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-character-reference)

Cipher
: An algorithm for encryption or decryption. To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cipher)

Class
: An extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default constructor of the class (a subroutine that creates objects), and as the type of objects generated by instantiating the class.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-class)
: In web development, the (value of the) `class` attribute, usually used as a selector for styling purposes.

CLI
: ‚Üí Command-Line Interface

Click
: A physical or emulated interaction with a pointing device.

Click-Through Rate
: The ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-ctr)

Client
: A piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server. The server is often (but not always) on another computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of a network.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-client)

Client Hints
: A set of HTTP request header fields for proactive content negotiation allowing clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences. Client Hints enable automated delivery of optimized assets like the automatic negotiation of image DPR resolution.&nbsp;[‚Ä°](#m-client-hints)

Client side
: Operations on the client as opposed to the server side in a client-server relationship.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-client-side)

Closure
: A technique for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions. Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function together with an environment. The environment is a mapping associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created. Unlike a plain function, a closure allows the function to access those captured variables through the closure‚Äôs copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-closure)

CMS
: ‚Üí Content Management System

Coalescing
: The merging of two adjacent free blocks of memory, which is relevant as when an application frees memory, gaps can fall in the memory segment that the application uses.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-coalescing)
: A way to provide a default value if an operand is `null` or `undefined`. This so-called null or nullish coalescing allows a default value to be defined for cases where a more specific value is not available.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-coalescing-operator)

Chaining
: The calling of several methods after another on an object.

Code
: The set of instructions forming a computer program which is executed by a computer. It is one of two components of the software which runs on computer hardware, the other being the data.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-code)

Code point
: Any of the numerical values that make up the code space for a character encoding. Many code points represent single characters but they can also have other meanings, such as for formatting.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-code-point)

Code splitting
: The splitting of code into various bundles or components which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. While the total amount of code is the same (and perhaps even a few bytes larger), the amount of code needed during initial load can be reduced.&nbsp;[‚Ä°](#m-code-splitting)

CoffeeScript
: A programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python, and Haskell in an effort to enhance JavaScript‚Äôs brevity and readability. Specific additional features include list comprehension and destructuring assignment.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-coffeescript) üåç&nbsp;[coffeescript.org](https://coffeescript.org/)

Color blindness
: The decreased ability to see color or differences in color. 8% of men and 0.5% of women have some form of color blindness. The most common forms of color blindness are deuteranomaly, deuteranopia, protanomaly, and protanopia.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-color-blindness)

Command
: A directive to a computer program to perform a specific task. It may be issued via a command-line interface, such as a shell, or as input to a network service as part of a network protocol, or as an event in a graphical user interface triggered by the user selecting an option in a menu.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-command)

Command-Line Interface
: An interface processing commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. Operating systems implement command-line interfaces in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cli)

Comment
: A developer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. Comments are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters. The syntax of comments in various programming languages varies considerably.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-comment)

Compatibility
: The ability of software to run on a particular architecture or operating system, and the ability of hardware to work with a particular CPU architecture, bus, motherboard, or operating system. Compatible software and hardware may not always run at its highest stated performance.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-compatibility)

Compatibility mode
: A software mechanism in which a software either emulates an older version of software, or mimics another operating system in order to allow older or incompatible software or files to remain compatible with the computer‚Äôs newer hardware or software. Examples of the software using the mode are operating systems and Internet Explorer.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-compatibility-mode)

Compiling
: Translating computer code written in one programming language into another language.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-compiler)

Compiler
: A computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-compiler)

Component
: A software package, a web service, a web resource, or a module that encapsulates a set of related functions or data. All system processes are placed into separate components so that all of the data and functions inside each component are semantically related (just as with the contents of classes). Because of this principle, it is often said that components are modular and cohesive.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-component)

Component-Based Development
: ‚Üí Component-Based Software Engineering

Component-Based Software Engineering
: A branch of software engineering that emphasizes the separation of concerns with respect to the wide-ranging functionality available throughout a given software system. It is a reuse-based approach to defining, implementing and composing loosely coupled independent components into systems.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cbse)

Compression
: The process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Any particular compression is either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred to as an encoder, and one that performs the reversal of the process (decompression) as a decoder.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-compression)

Concurrent Versioning System
: ‚Üí Concurrent Versions System

Concurrent Versions System
: A client-server revision control system. CVS was developed in 1986 by Dick Grune.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cvs) üåç&nbsp;[savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs)

Conditional
: A set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is completed or not. An instruction or a set of instructions is executed, if a specific condition is fulfilled. Otherwise, another instruction is executed. It is also possible to repeat the execution of an instruction, or set of instructions, while a condition is not yet fulfilled.&nbsp;[‚Ä°](#m-conditional)

Conditional Comments
: Conditional statements in HTML interpreted by Microsoft Internet Explorer 5‚Äì9. Conditional comments can be used to provide and hide code to and from Internet Explorer. Conditional comments are no longer supported in IE 10 and 11.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-conditional-comments)

Cone of Uncertainty
: A model for the evolution of the amount of best case uncertainty during a project. At the beginning of a project, comparatively little is known about the product or work results, and so estimates are subject to large uncertainty. As more research and development is done, more information is learned about the project, and the uncertainty then tends to decrease. The change in uncertainty makes for the shape of a cone.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cone-of-uncertainty)

Console
: A computer program designed to be used via a text-only computer interface, such as a text terminal, the command line interface of some operating systems (Unix, DOS, etc.) or the text-based interface included with most Graphical User Interface (GUI) operating systems, such as the Win32 console in Microsoft Windows, the Terminal in macOS, and xterm in Unix. A user typically interacts with a console application using only a keyboard and display screen.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-console)

Constant
: A value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution, i.e., the value is constant. When associated with an identifier, a constant is said to be ‚Äúnamed,‚Äù although the terms ‚Äúconstant‚Äù and ‚Äúnamed constant‚Äù are often used interchangeably. This is contrasted with a variable.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-constant)

Constructor
: A special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-constructor)

Content Delivery Network
: A geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers that has the goal to provide high availability and high performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end-users. CDNs came into existence in the late 1990s as a means for alleviating the performance bottlenecks of the Internet. They are a layer in the internet ecosystem.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cdn)

Content Management System
: A software application that can be used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. CMSs are typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content management (WCM). ECM typically supports multiple users in a collaborative environment by integrating document management, digital asset management and record retention. Alternatively, WCM is the collaborative authoring for websites and may include text and embed graphics, photos, video, audio, maps and programme code that display content and interact with the user.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cms)

Content Security Policy
: A computer security standard introduced to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other code injection attacks resulting from execution of malicious content in the trusted web page context. CSP provides a standard method for website owners to declare approved origins of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that website‚Äîcovered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, web workers, fonts, images, embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files, and other HTML5 features.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-csp) üåç&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/CSP](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/)

Continuous Delivery
: A software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually. CD aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency, and helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-continuous-delivery)

Continuous Deployment
: A software engineering approach in which software functionalities are delivered frequently through automated deployments.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-continuous-deployment)

Continuous Integration
: The practice of merging all developers‚Äô working copies to a shared mainline (version control) several times a day.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-continuous-integration)

Continuous Media
: Data for which there is a timing relationship between source and destination. The most common examples of continuous media are audio and motion video. Continuous media can be real-time (interactive), where there is a ‚Äútight‚Äù timing relationship between source and sink, or streaming (playback), where the relationship is less strict.&nbsp;[‚Ä°](#m-continuous-media)

Contrast
: The difference in appearance of two or more parts of a field seen simultaneously or successively (hence: brightness contrast, lightness contrast, color contrast, simultaneous contrast, successive contrast, etc.). Visual information is always contained in some kind of visual contrast, thus contrast is an essential performance (and accessibility) feature of electronic visual displays.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-contrast)

Cookie
: A small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user‚Äôs computer by the user‚Äôs web browser while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information or to record the user‚Äôs browsing activity. They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered. Cookies perform essential functions in the modern Web. Perhaps most importantly, authentication cookies are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in with.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cookie)

Corporate Design
: The official graphical design of the logo and name of a company or institution (or government) used on letterheads, envelopes, forms, folders, brochures, etc.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-corporate-design)

Corporate Identity
: The manner in which a corporation, firm, or business enterprise presents itself to the public. The corporate identity is typically visualized by branding and with the use of trademarks, but it can also include things like product design, advertising, public relations, etc. Corporate identity is a primary goal of corporate communications, in order to maintain and build the identity to accord with and facilitate the corporate business objectives.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-corporate-identity)

CORS
: ‚Üí Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

Crawler
: An Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering). Web search engines and some other sites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indices of others sites‚Äô web content.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-crawler)

CRM
: ‚Üí Customer Relationship Management

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
: A mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. A web page may freely embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos. Certain ‚Äúcross-domain‚Äù requests are forbidden by default by the same-origin security policy. CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-cors)

Cross-Site Scripting
: A type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-xss)
