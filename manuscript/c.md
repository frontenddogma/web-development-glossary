Cache
: A hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere. A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot. Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store.&nbsp;[†](#w-cache)

Callback
: Executable code that is provided as an argument to other code that executes—calls back—that argument immediately (synchronous callback) or at a later time (asynchronous callback).&nbsp;[†](#w-callback)

Canvas
: A container, the HTML `canvas` element, that allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D and 3D shapes and bitmap images by providing an empty graphic zone on which specific JavaScript APIs can draw (such as Canvas 2D or WebGL).&nbsp;[‡](#m-canvas)

Card sorting
: A method that aids the design or evaluation of the information architecture of a website. Card sorting is usually performed with groups, with attendees organizing topics into categories or folksonomies.

Caret
: A grapheme—“^”, “‸”, “⁁”, or “＾”—with several uses, including as a proofreading mark, as a special character in programming languages, as an escape character, or for estimation.&nbsp;[†](#w-caret)

Cascading Style Sheets
: A style sheet language that allows to manage the presentation of markup languages like HTML or XML. The first final specification of CSS was published in 1996 by Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos. 🌍&nbsp;[w3.org/Style/CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)

Case
: In engineering, as _use_ case, a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role (known in UML as an actor) and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or other external system. In systems engineering, use cases are used at a higher level than within software engineering, often representing missions or stakeholder goals.&nbsp;[†](#w-case-engineering)
: In programming, a selection mechanism to allow a variable to change the flow of a program.&nbsp;[†](#w-case-programming)
: In typography, as _letter_ case, the distinction between the letters that are in larger upper case (also uppercase, capital letters, capitals, caps, large letters, or more formally majuscule) and smaller lower case (also lowercase, small letters, or more formally minuscule) in the written representation of certain languages.&nbsp;[†](#w-case-typography)

Certificate
: An electronic document used to prove the ownership of a public key. The certificate includes information about the key, information about the identity of its owner (called the subject), and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate’s contents (called the issuer).&nbsp;[†](#w-certificate)

Character
: An encoded symbol that maps to a glyph.

Character encoding
: A specific mapping of code points to characters, like UTF-8.

Chrome
: A cross-platform web browser. Chrome was released in 2008 by Google. 🌍&nbsp;[google.com/chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
: The graphical elements of a web browser, like title, address, and status bar as well as navigation elements.

Cipher
: An algorithm for encryption or decryption.

Class
: In software development, a concrete data structure and template for creating objects.
: In web development, the (value of the) `class` attribute, usually used as a selector for styling purposes. 

CLI

Click
: A physical or emulated interaction with a pointing device.

Clickthrough Rate
: The ratio of how often users who see a page, email, or advertisement and click on a specific element in it.

Client
: Hardware or software that accesses a service provided by a server, which is usually remote but may also be local.

Client Hints
: A mechanism to allow for proactive content negotiation. 

Client side
: Activities on the client as opposed to the server side in a client-server relationship. 

Closure
: A function bundled with references to its surrounding state (lexical environment), allowing access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function.

Coalescing
: The merging of two adjacent free blocks of memory.
: A way to provide a default value if an operand is `null` or `undefined` (nullish coalescing). 

Chaining
: The calling of several methods after another on an object.

Code
: The set of instructions forming a computer program which is executed by a computer. It is one of two components of the software which runs on computer hardware, the other being the data.&nbsp;[†](#w-code)

Code point
: A numerical representation of a single character or formatting sign.

Code splitting
: The splitting of code into small chunks that represent the code currently needed, usually by a web app.

Color blindness
: A deficiency in seeing color meaning difficulty in differentiating between colors. 8% of men and 0.5% of women have some form of color blindness ([color-blindness.com](https://www.color-blindness.com/types-of-color-blindness/)). The most common forms of color blindness are deuteranomaly, deuteranopia, protanomaly, and protanopia. 

Command-Line Interface
: An interface processing commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. Operating systems implement command-line interfaces in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services.&nbsp;[†](#w-cli)
