Tab
: An individual navigational GUI element (and associated content) of a tabbed document interface.

Tabbed Document Interface
: A graphical control element that allows multiple documents or panels to be contained within a single window, using tabs as a navigational widget for switching between sets of documents. It is an interface style most commonly associated with web browsers, web applications, text editors, and preference panes, with window managers, especially tiling window managers, being lesser known examples.

Table box
: A block-level box that contains a table’s internal boxes.

Table formatting context
: A formatting context which is used to lay out table elements.

Tachyons
: A presentational HTML/CSS framework. ℹ︎&nbsp;[tachyons.io](https://tachyons.io/)

Tag
: In version control, a textual label that can be associated with a specific revision of a project maintained by a version control system. A tag allows to define a meaningful name to be given to a particular state of a project that is under version control. This label can then be used in place of the revision identifier for commands supported by the version control system.&nbsp;[†](#w-tag)
: In web development, either the start or end tag of an HTML element, like `<p>`, a paragraph’s start tag, or `</ul>`, an unordered list’s end tag. Not to be confused with an element.

Tcl
: A high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. It was designed with the goal of being simple but powerful. Tcl casts everything into the mold of a command, even programming constructs like variable assignment and procedure definition. Tcl supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming, or procedural styles.&nbsp;[†](#w-tcl) ℹ︎&nbsp;[tcl-lang.org](https://www.tcl-lang.org/)

Technical standard
: An established norm or requirement for a repeatable technical task. It is usually a formal document that establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria, methods, processes, and practices. In contrast, a custom, convention, company product, corporate standard, and so forth that becomes generally accepted and dominant is often called a de facto standard. A technical standard may be developed privately or unilaterally, for example by a corporation, regulatory body, military, etc. Standards can also be developed by groups such as trade unions and trade associations. Standards organizations often have more diverse input and usually develop voluntary standards: these might become mandatory if adopted by a government (i.e., through legislation), business contract, etc.&nbsp;[†](#w-technical-standard)

Telnet
: An application protocol used on the Internet or local area network to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection. User data is interspersed in-band with Telnet control information in an 8-bit byte oriented data connection over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Telnet was developed in 1969 beginning with RFC 15, extended in RFC 855, and standardized as Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Internet Standard STD 8, one of the first Internet standards. The name stands for “teletype network.”&nbsp;[†](#w-telnet)

Template
: A static or dynamic file used to create or duplicate other files. 
: The HTML `template` element and respective use with web components.

Template language
: The syntax used by a template processor.

Template processor
: Software designed to combine templates with a data model to produce result documents. The language that the templates are written in is known as a template language or templating language. A result document may be any kind of formatted output, including documents, web pages, or source code (in source code generation), either in whole or in fragments. A template engine is ordinarily included as a part of a web template system or application framework, and may be used also as a preprocessor or filter.&nbsp;[†](#w-template-processor)

Template system
: A platform that lets web designers and developers work with web templates to automatically generate custom web pages. This reuses static web page elements while defining dynamic elements based on web request parameters. Web templates support static content, providing basic structure and appearance. Developers can implement templates from content management systems, web application frameworks, and HTML editors.&nbsp;[†](#w-template-system)

TeX
: A typesetting system (or formatting system) which was designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. TeX is a popular means of typesetting complex mathematical formulae; it has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical systems.&nbsp;[†](#w-tex) ℹ︎&nbsp;[tug.org](https://tug.org/)

Theme
: A preset package containing graphical appearance details. For operating systems, a theme usually comprises a set of shapes and colors for the graphical control elements, the window decoration and the window. Themes are used to customize the look and feel of software in general, including for websites and apps.&nbsp;[†](#w-theme)

Transport Layer Security
: A cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. Several versions of the TLS (and SSL) protocols find widespread use in applications such as web browsing, email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). Websites can use TLS to secure all communications between their servers and web browsers. The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications. TLS was first specified in 1999.&nbsp;[†](#w-tls)

TrustRank
: An algorithm that conducts link analysis to separate useful webpages from spam and helps search engine rank pages in SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages). It is semi-automated process which means that it needs some human assistance in order to function properly. Search engines have many different algorithms and ranking factors that they use when measuring the quality of webpages, including TrustRank.&nbsp;[†](#w-trustrank)

Typeface
: The overall design of lettering, whose design can include variations, such as extra bold, bold, regular, light, italic, condensed, extended, etc. Each of these variations of the typeface is a font. Every typeface is a collection of glyphs, each of which represents an individual letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbol. Not to be confused with a font; before the advent of digital typography and desktop publishing, the two terms had more clearly understood meanings.&nbsp;[†](#w-typeface)
