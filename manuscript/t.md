Tabbed Document Interface
: A graphical control element that allows multiple documents or panels to be contained within a single window, using tabs as a navigational widget for switching between sets of documents. It is an interface style most commonly associated with web browsers, web applications, text editors, and preference panes, with window managers, especially tiling window managers, being lesser known examples.

Table box
: A block-level box that contains a table’s internal boxes.

Table formatting context
: A formatting context which is used to lay out table elements.

Tachyons
: A presentational HTML/CSS framework. ℹ︎&nbsp;[tachyons.io](https://tachyons.io/)

Tag
: In version control, a textual label that can be associated with a specific revision of a project maintained by a version control system. A tag allows to define a meaningful name to be given to a particular state of a project that is under version control. This label can then be used in place of the revision identifier for commands supported by the version control system.&nbsp;[†](#w-tag)
: In web development, either the start or end tag of an HTML element, like `<p>`, a paragraph’s start tag, or `</ul>`, an unordered list’s end tag. Not to be confused with an element.

Tag Management System
: A software designed to help manage the lifecycle of e-marketing tags (sometimes referred to as tracking pixels or web beacons), which are used to integrate third-party software into digital properties. Tag management systems replace marketing tags with a single container tag and subsequently prioritize and “fire” individual tags as appropriate based on business rules, navigation events and known data.[2] Typical functionality includes testing environment (sandboxing), audit trail and version control, ability to A/B test different solutions, tag deduplication, and role-based access to data.&nbsp;[†](#w-tms)

Tailoring
: The developing and refactoring to precise dimensions and needs.

tar
: A computer software utility for collecting many files into one archive file, often referred to as a tarball, for distribution or backup purposes. The name is derived from “tape archive”, as it was originally developed to write data to sequential I/O devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various file system parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and directory organization. The command line utility was first introduced in the Version 7 Unix in 1979, replacing the tp program.&nbsp;[†](#w-tar)

Tarball
: A tar archive file.

Tcl
: A high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. It was designed with the goal of being simple but powerful. Tcl casts everything into the mold of a command, even programming constructs like variable assignment and procedure definition. Tcl supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming, or procedural styles.&nbsp;[†](#w-tcl) ℹ︎&nbsp;[tcl-lang.org](https://www.tcl-lang.org/)

Tech Twitter
: A colloquial name for the tech-savvy users of the Twitter microblogging and social networking service.

Technical debt
: A concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. As with monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate “interest,” making it harder to implement changes. Unaddressed technical debt increases software entropy. Technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes (e.g., as a proof-of-concept) is required to move projects forward. On the other hand, the “technical debt” metaphor may minimize impact and result in insufficient prioritization of the necessary work to correct it.&nbsp;[†](#w-technical-debt)

Technical standard
: An established norm or requirement for a repeatable technical task. It is usually a formal document that establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria, methods, processes, and practices. In contrast, a custom, convention, company product, corporate standard, and so forth that becomes generally accepted and dominant is often called a de facto standard. A technical standard may be developed privately or unilaterally, for example by a corporation, regulatory body, military, etc. Standards can also be developed by groups such as trade unions and trade associations. Standards organizations often have more diverse input and usually develop voluntary standards: these might become mandatory if adopted by a government (i.e., through legislation), business contract, etc.&nbsp;[†](#w-technical-standard)

Telnet
: An application protocol used on the Internet or local area network to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection. User data is interspersed in-band with Telnet control information in an 8-bit byte oriented data connection over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Telnet was developed in 1969 beginning with RFC 15, extended in RFC 855, and standardized as Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Internet Standard STD 8, one of the first Internet standards. The name stands for “teletype network.”&nbsp;[†](#w-telnet)

Template
: A static or dynamic file used to create or duplicate other files. 
: The HTML `template` element and respective use with web components.

Template language
: The syntax used by a template processor.

Template processor
: Software designed to combine templates with a data model to produce result documents. The language that the templates are written in is known as a template language or templating language. A result document may be any kind of formatted output, including documents, web pages, or source code (in source code generation), either in whole or in fragments. A template engine is ordinarily included as a part of a web template system or application framework, and may be used also as a preprocessor or filter.&nbsp;[†](#w-template-processor)

Template system
: A platform that lets web designers and developers work with web templates to automatically generate custom web pages. This reuses static web page elements while defining dynamic elements based on web request parameters. Web templates support static content, providing basic structure and appearance. Developers can implement templates from content management systems, web application frameworks, and HTML editors.&nbsp;[†](#w-template-system)

Ternary operator
: An operator that takes three arguments. The arguments and result can be of different types. Many programming languages that use C-like syntax feature a ternary operator, `?:`, which defines a conditional expression. In some languages, this operator is referred to as the conditional operator.&nbsp;[†](#w-ternary-operator)

Tesler’s Law
: An adage in human–computer interaction stating that every application has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed or hidden. Instead, it must be dealt with, either in product development or in user interaction. This poses the question of who should be exposed to the complexity. For example, should a software developer add complexity to the software code to make the interaction simpler for the user or should the user deal with a complex interface so that the software code can be simple?&nbsp;[†](#w-teslers-law)

Testing
: An investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software product or service under test. Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test techniques include the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or other defects), and verifying that the software product is fit for use.&nbsp;[†](#w-testing)

Test-Driven Development
: A software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: Requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass. This is opposed to software development that allows code to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming concepts of extreme programming, begun in 1999, but more recently has created more general interest in its own right.&nbsp;[†](#w-tdd)

TeX
: A typesetting system (or formatting system) which was designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. TeX is a popular means of typesetting complex mathematical formulae; it has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical systems.&nbsp;[†](#w-tex) ℹ︎&nbsp;[tug.org](https://tug.org/)

Theme
: A preset package containing graphical appearance details. For operating systems, a theme usually comprises a set of shapes and colors for the graphical control elements, the window decoration and the window. Themes are used to customize the look and feel of software in general, including for websites and apps.&nbsp;[†](#w-theme)

Third party
: A supplier (or service provider) who is not directly controlled by either the seller (first party) nor the buyer (second party) in a transaction. In technology, a third party may be a supplier of software (or a computer accessory) which is independent of the supplier and customer of the product or service.&nbsp;[†](#w-third-party)

`this`
: A keyword whose value is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It cannot be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called. ES5 introduced the `bind()` method to set the value of a function’s this regardless of how it is called, and ES2015 introduced arrow functions which do not provide their own this binding (it retains the this value of the enclosing lexical context).&nbsp;[‡](#m-this)

Thread
: The smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system. The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process. Multiple threads can exist within one process, executing concurrently and sharing resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources. In particular, the threads of a process share its executable code and the values of its dynamically allocated variables and non-thread-local global variables at any given time.&nbsp;[†](#w-thread)

Time box
: A fixed time period.

Time to First Byte
: A measurement used as an indication of the responsiveness of a webserver or other network resource. TTFB measures the duration from the user or client making an HTTP request to the first byte of the page being received by the client’s browser. This time is made up of the socket connection time, the time taken to send the HTTP request, and the time taken to get the first byte of the page. Although sometimes misunderstood as a post-DNS calculation, the original calculation of TTFB in networking always includes network latency in measuring the time it takes for a resource to begin loading.&nbsp;[†](#w-ttfb)

Time to Interactive
: A non-standardized web performance “progress” metric defined as the point in time when the last Long Task finished and was followed by 5 seconds of network and main thread inactivity. TTI, proposed by the Web Incubator Community Group in 2018, is intended to provide a metric that describes when a page or application contains useful content and the main thread is idle and free to respond to user interactions, including having event handlers registered.&nbsp;[‡](#m-tti)

Time to Live
: A mechanism that limits the lifespan or lifetime of data in a computer or network. TTL may be implemented as a counter or timestamp attached to or embedded in the data. Once the prescribed event count or timespan has elapsed, data is discarded or revalidated. In computer networking, TTL prevents a data packet from circulating indefinitely. In computing applications, TTL is commonly used to improve the performance and manage the caching of data.&nbsp;[†](#w-ttl)

Tiny integer
: An integral data type of 8 bits, with a signed range from –128 to 127, and an unsigned range from 0 to 255.

Top-Level Domain
: One of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet. The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is, the last label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name www.example.com, the top-level domain is com. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root zone.&nbsp;[†](#w-tld)

Transport Layer Security
: A cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. Several versions of the TLS (and SSL) protocols find widespread use in applications such as web browsing, email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). Websites can use TLS to secure all communications between their servers and web browsers. The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications. TLS was first specified in 1999.&nbsp;[†](#w-tls)

Typeface
: The overall design of lettering, whose design can include variations, such as extra bold, bold, regular, light, italic, condensed, extended, etc. Each of these variations of the typeface is a font. Every typeface is a collection of glyphs, each of which represents an individual letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbol. Not to be confused with a font; before the advent of digital typography and desktop publishing, the two terms had more clearly understood meanings.&nbsp;[†](#w-typeface)
