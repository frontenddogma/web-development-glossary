Tab
: An individual navigational GUI element (and associated content) of a tabbed document interface.

Tab icon
: → Favicon

Tabbed Document Interface
: A graphical control element that allows multiple documents or panels to be contained within a single window, using tabs as a navigational widget for switching between sets of documents. It is an interface style most commonly associated with web browsers, web applications, text editors, and preference panes, with window managers, especially tiling window managers, being lesser known examples.

Table box
: A block-level box that contains a table’s internal boxes.

Table formatting context
: A formatting context which is used to lay out table elements.

Tachyons
: A presentational HTML/CSS framework. ℹ︎&nbsp;[tachyons.io](https://tachyons.io/)

Tag
: In version control, a textual label that can be associated with a specific revision of a project maintained by a version control system. A tag allows to define a meaningful name to be given to a particular state of a project that is under version control. This label can then be used in place of the revision identifier for commands supported by the version control system.&nbsp;[†](#w-tag)
: In web development, either the start or end tag of an HTML element, like `<p>`, a paragraph’s start tag, or `</ul>`, an unordered list’s end tag. Not to be confused with an element.
: → Tracking pixel

Tag Management System
: A software designed to help manage the lifecycle of e-marketing tags (sometimes referred to as tracking pixels or web beacons), which are used to integrate third-party software into digital properties. Tag management systems replace marketing tags with a single container tag and subsequently prioritize and “fire” individual tags as appropriate based on business rules, navigation events, and known data. Typical functionality includes a testing environment (sandbox), an audit trail and version control, the ability to A/B-test different solutions, tag de-duplication, and role-based access to data.&nbsp;[†](#w-tms)

Tag soup
: A pejorative for syntactically or structurally incorrect HTML written for a web page. Because web browsers have historically treated HTML syntax or structural errors leniently, there has been little pressure for web developers to follow published standards, and therefore there is a need for all browser implementations to provide mechanisms to cope with the appearance of “tag soup,” accepting and correcting for invalid syntax and structure where possible.&nbsp;[†](#w-tag-soup)

Tagging
: → Folksonomy

Tailoring
: The developing and refactoring to precise dimensions and needs.

tar
: A computer software utility for collecting many files into one archive file, often referred to as a tarball, for distribution or backup purposes. The name is derived from “tape archive,” as it was originally developed to write data to sequential I/O devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various file system parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and directory organization. The command-line utility was first introduced in the Version 7 Unix in 1979, replacing the tp program.&nbsp;[†](#w-tar)

Tarball
: A tar archive file.

TBT
: → Total Blocking Time

Tcl
: A high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, and dynamic programming language. It was designed with the goal of being simple but powerful. Tcl casts everything into the mold of a command, even programming constructs like variable assignment and procedure definition. Tcl supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming, as well as procedural styles.&nbsp;[†](#w-tcl) ℹ︎&nbsp;[tcl-lang.org](https://www.tcl-lang.org/)

Tech Twitter
: A colloquial name for the tech-savvy users of the Twitter microblogging and social networking service.

Technical debt
: A concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. As with monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate “interest,” making it harder to implement changes. Unaddressed technical debt increases software entropy. Technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes (e.g., as a proof of concept) is required to move projects forward. On the other hand, the “technical debt” metaphor may minimize impact and result in insufficient prioritization of the necessary work to correct it.&nbsp;[†](#w-technical-debt)

Technical Lead
: A software or web developer in charge of one or more software projects. Alternative titles include lead programmer, development lead, lead software engineer, software design engineer lead (SDE lead), software development manager, software manager, or lead application developer. When primarily contributing in a high-level enterprise software design role, the title software architect (or similar) is often used.&nbsp;[†](#w-lead)

Technical Program Manager
: An engineering-related role that is responsible for managing technical projects and initiatives.

Technical standard
: An established norm or requirement for a repeatable technical task. A technical standard is usually a formal document that establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria, methods, processes, and practices. In contrast, a custom, convention, company product, corporate standard, and so forth that becomes generally accepted and dominant is often called a _de facto_ standard. A technical standard may be developed privately or unilaterally, for example by a corporation, regulatory body, military, etc. Standards can also be developed by groups such as trade unions and trade associations. Standards organizations often have more diverse input and usually develop voluntary standards which may become mandatory if adopted by a government (i.e., through legislation) or business contract.&nbsp;[†](#w-technical-standard)

Technological Protection Measures
: → Digital Rights Management

Telnet
: An application protocol used on the Internet or a local area network to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection. User data is interspersed in-band with Telnet control information in an 8-bit byte-oriented data connection over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Telnet was developed in 1969 beginning with RFC&nbsp;15, extended in RFC&nbsp;855, and standardized as Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Internet Standard STD 8, one of the first Internet standards. The name stands for “teletype network.”&nbsp;[†](#w-telnet)

Template
: A static or dynamic file used to create or duplicate other files.
: The HTML `template` element and respective use with web components.

Template language
: The syntax used by a template processor.

Template processor
: A software designed to combine templates with a data model to produce result documents. The language that the templates are written in is known as a template language or templating language. A result document may be any kind of formatted output, including documents, web pages, or source code (in source code generation), either in whole or in fragments. A template engine is ordinarily included as a part of a web template system or application framework, and may be used also as a preprocessor or filter.&nbsp;[†](#w-template-processor)

Template system
: A platform that lets web designers and developers work with web templates to automatically generate custom web pages. This reuses static web page elements while defining dynamic elements based on web request parameters. Web templates support static content, providing basic structure and appearance. Developers can implement templates from content management systems, web application frameworks, and HTML editors.&nbsp;[†](#w-template-system)

Temporal Dead Zone
: In JavaScript, an expression for the fact that `let` and `const` cannot be accessed before they are declared, with this resulting in a reference error. The TDZ encourages to always declare a variable before using it.

Ten-Second Rule
: A rough limit for user attention. After ten seconds, the probability is deemed to increase that users start to engage in other activities, or abandon a process or site.

Terminal
: → Console

Ternary operator
: An operator that takes three arguments. The arguments and result can be of different types. Many programming languages that use C-like syntax feature a ternary operator, `?:`, which defines a conditional expression. In some languages, this operator is referred to as the conditional operator.&nbsp;[†](#w-ternary-operator)

Tesler’s Law
: An adage in human-computer interaction stating that every application has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed or hidden. Instead, it must be dealt with, either in product development or in user interaction, which poses the question of who should be exposed to the complexity. For example, should a software developer add complexity to the software code to make the interaction simpler for the user, or should a user deal with a complex interface so that the software code can be simple?&nbsp;[†](#w-teslers-law)

Test pyramid
: A concept by which unit tests, service tests, and UI tests, when drawn in comparison to their desired number and suspected cost (from many cheap unit tests to few expensive UI tests), form a pyramid. The test (automation) pyramid is attributed to Mike Cohn, who wrote about it in 2009.

Test-Driven Development
: A software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: Requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass. This is opposed to software development that allows code to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. Test-driven development is related to the “test first” programming concepts of Extreme Programming (XP), begun in 1999, but more recently has created more general interest in its own right.&nbsp;[†](#w-tdd)

Testing
: An investigation conducted to provide information about the quality of the software product or service under test. Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test techniques include the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or other defects), and verifying that the software product is fit for use.&nbsp;[†](#w-testing)

TeX
: A typesetting or formatting system. TeX is a popular means of typesetting complex mathematical formulae; it has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical systems. TeX was released in 1978 by Donald Knuth.&nbsp;[†](#w-tex) ℹ︎&nbsp;[tug.org](https://tug.org/)

Theme
: A preset package containing graphical appearance details. For operating systems, a theme usually comprises a set of shapes and colors for window, window decoration, and graphical control elements. Themes are used to customize the look and feel of software in general, including for websites and apps.&nbsp;[†](#w-theme)

Third party
: A supplier (or service provider) who is not directly controlled by either the seller (first party) nor the buyer (second party) in a transaction. In technology, a third party may be a provider of software (or a computer accessory) which is independent of the supplier and customer of the product or service.&nbsp;[†](#w-third-party)

`this`
: A keyword whose value is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It cannot be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called. ES5 introduced the `bind()` method to set the value of a function’s `this` regardless of how it is called, and ES2015 introduced arrow functions which do not provide their own `this` binding (it retains the `this` value of the enclosing lexical context).&nbsp;[‡](#m-this)

Thread
: The smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system. The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process. Multiple threads can exist within one process, executing concurrently and sharing resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources.&nbsp;[†](#w-thread)

Three-Click Rule
: An unofficial, debunked web design rule concerning the design of website navigation. The Three-Click Rule suggests that a user of a website should be able to find information with no more than three mouse clicks. It is based on the belief that users of a site will become frustrated and often leave if they cannot find the information within three clicks. The rule has explicitly been [called out as false](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/3-click-rule/) by usability specialists Nielsen Norman Group.&nbsp;[†](#w-three-click-rule)

Time box
: A fixed time period.

Time to First Byte
: A measurement used as an indication of the responsiveness of a web server or other network resource. TTFB measures the duration from the user or client making an HTTP request to the first byte of the page being received by the client’s browser. This time is made up of the socket connection time, the time taken to send the HTTP request, and the time taken to get the first byte of the page. Although sometimes misunderstood as a post-DNS calculation, the original calculation of TTFB in networking always includes network latency in measuring the time it takes for a resource to begin loading.&nbsp;[†](#w-ttfb)

Time to Interactive
: A non-standardized web performance “progress” metric defined as the point in time when the last long task finished and was followed by five seconds of network and main thread inactivity. TTI, proposed by the Web Incubator Community Group in 2018, is intended to provide a metric that describes when a page or application contains useful content and the main thread is idle and free to respond to user interactions, including having event handlers registered.&nbsp;[‡](#m-tti)

Time to Live
: A mechanism that limits the lifespan or lifetime of data in a computer or network. TTL may be implemented as a counter or timestamp attached to or embedded in the data. Once the prescribed event count or timespan has elapsed, data is discarded or revalidated. In computer networking, TTL prevents a data packet from circulating indefinitely. In computing applications, TTL is commonly used to improve the performance and manage the caching of data.&nbsp;[†](#w-ttl)

Timestamp
: A sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from rubber stamps used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when a document was received.&nbsp;[†](#w-timestamp)

tink
: An experimental package manager for the JavaScript programming language. ℹ︎&nbsp;[github.com/npm/tink](https://github.com/npm/tink)

Tiny integer
: An integral data type of 8 bits, with a signed range from –128 to 127, and an unsigned range from 0 to 255.

Tokenization
: The process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent, referred to as a token, that has no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value. The token is a reference (i.e., identifier) that maps back to the sensitive data through a tokenization system.&nbsp;[†](#w-tokenization)

Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language
: A configuration file format that is intended to be easy to read and write due to obvious semantics which aim to be minimal, and that is designed to map unambiguously to a dictionary. TOML was released in 2013 by Tom Preston-Werner.&nbsp;[†](#w-toml) ℹ︎&nbsp;[github.com/toml-lang/toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)

Tooling
: All the software used in the development process. The term “tooling” is often used particularly to refer to CLI tools and scripts with which parts of a workflow are being supported or automated.

Top-Level Domain
: One of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet. The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is, the last label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name “example.com”, the top-level domain is “com”. Responsibility for the management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root zone.&nbsp;[†](#w-tld)

Top-posting
: A posting style in which the reply precedes the quoted original message.&nbsp;[†](#w-posting-style)

Tor
: A project, software, and network for enabling anonymous communication. The name is derived from an acronym for the original software project name “The Onion Router.” Tor directs Internet traffic through a free, world-wide, volunteer overlay network consisting of more than 7,000 relays to conceal a user’s location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity to the user. Tor’s intended use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities unmonitored. Tor does not prevent an online service from determining when it is being accessed through Tor. Tor protects a user’s privacy, but does not hide the fact that someone is using Tor. Tor was first released in 2002.&nbsp;[†](#w-tor) ℹ︎&nbsp;[torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org/)

Tor Browser
: A cross-platform web browser and the flagship product of the Tor Project. It was created as the Tor Browser Bundle by Steven J. Murdoch and announced in 2008. The Tor Browser consists of a modified Firefox ESR web browser, the TorButton, TorLauncher, NoScript, and HTTPS Everywhere Firefox extensions, and the Tor proxy. Users can run the Tor Browser from removable media.&nbsp;[†](#w-tor)

: → Technological Protection Measures

Tracer code
: A concept from _The Pragmatic Programmer_, the developing of skeleton functionality that can serve as a proof of concept but also remain part of the later software. “Tracer code,” or “code as tracer bullets,” is a term borrowed from military shooting with brightly-colored tracer ammunition. Tracer code is different from prototyping, whose code may be abandoned.

Tracing
: A specialized use of logging to record information about a program’s execution. This information is typically used by programmers for debugging purposes, and additionally, depending on the type and detail of information contained in a trace log, by experienced system administrators or technical support personnel and by software monitoring tools to diagnose common problems with software. Tracing is a cross-cutting concern. There is not always a clear distinction between tracing and other forms of logging, except that the term “tracing” is almost never applied to logging that is a functional requirement of a program.&nbsp;[†](#w-tracing)

Tracking
: → Letter-spacing

Tracking pixel
: One of various techniques used on web pages and email to unobtrusively (usually invisibly) allow for checking that a user has accessed some content. Tracking pixels are typically used by third parties to monitor the activity of users of a website for the purpose of web analytics or page tagging. They can also be used for email tracking. Using such pixels, companies and organizations can track the online behavior of web users. At first, the companies doing such tracking were mainly advertisers and web analytics companies; later social media sites also started to use the same tracking techniques, for instance through the use of buttons which act as tracking beacons.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-beacon)

Transcript
: A text version of audio contents that is provided for and used by people who are not currently able to process audio information, who are hard of hearing, or who are deaf.

Transmission Control Protocol
: One of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation where it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP), which is why the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Major Internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, and file transfer rely on TCP. SSL/TLS often runs on top of TCP. TCP is connection-oriented, and a connection between client and server is established (passive open) before data can be sent. Three-way handshake (active open), retransmission, and error detection add to its reliability, though they also lengthen latency. Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides a connectionless datagram service that prioritizes time over reliability. TCP has its origins in 1974.&nbsp;[†](#w-tcp)

Transpiler
: A type of compiler that takes the source code of a program written in a programming language as its input and produces an equivalent source code in the same or a different programming language. Such a source-to-source compiler translates between programming languages that operate at approximately the same level of abstraction, while a traditional compiler translates from a higher level programming language to a lower level programming language.&nbsp;[†](#w-transpiler)

Transport Layer Security
: A cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. Several versions of the TLS (and SSL) protocols find widespread use in applications such as web browsing, email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). Websites can use TLS to secure all communications between their servers and web browsers. The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications. TLS was first specified in 1999.&nbsp;[†](#w-tls)

Tree-shaking
: A dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code written in ECMAScript dialects like JavaScript, TypeScript, or Dart into a single bundle that is loaded by a web browser. Rather than eliminating code that can never be executed, tree-shaking starts from entry point and includes only the code that is guaranteed to be executed. Tree-shaking is also described as “live code inclusion.”&nbsp;[†](#w-tree-shaking)

Triadic colors
: A color scheme that uses three colors equally spaced around the color wheel. Triadic colors tend to be quite vibrant, even when using pale or unsaturated versions of hues, offering a higher degree of contrast while at the same time retaining color harmony. The primary colors are an example of a triadic color scheme.&nbsp;[†](#w-color-scheme)

Trident
: A proprietary browser engine for the Microsoft Windows version of Internet Explorer, developed by Microsoft. Trident was first introduced with the release of Internet Explorer version 4.0 in 1997; it has been steadily upgraded and remains in use today. For versions 7 and 8 of Internet Explorer, Microsoft made significant changes to the Trident layout engine to improve compliance with web standards and add support for new technologies. In the Edge browser, Trident was superseded by its fork, EdgeHTML.&nbsp;[†](#w-trident)

Trust on First Use
: A security model used by client software which needs to establish a trust relationship with an unknown or not-yet-trusted endpoint. In a TOFU model, the client will try to look up the endpoint’s identifier, usually some kind of public key, in its local trust database. If no identifier exists yet for the endpoint, the client software will either prompt the user to determine if the client should trust the identifier or it will simply trust the identifier which was given and record the trust relationship into its trust database. If a different identifier is received in subsequent connections to the endpoint the client software will consider it to be untrusted. The TOFU approach can be used when connecting to arbitrary or unknown endpoints which do not have a trusted third party, such as a certificate authority.&nbsp;[†](#w-tofu)

Trust Upon First Use
: → Trust on First Use

TrustRank
: An algorithm that conducts link analysis to separate useful web pages from spam and helps search engine rank pages in SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages). It is a semi-automated process which means that it needs some human assistance in order to function properly. Search engines have many different algorithms and ranking factors that they use when measuring the quality of web pages, including TrustRank.&nbsp;[†](#w-trustrank)

`try`
: → `try`…`catch`

`try`…`catch`
: A particular exception handling statement that marks a block of statements to try and specifies a response should an exception be thrown. `try` can also be accompanied by a `finally` statement.&nbsp;[‡](#m-try-catch)

Turbo pages
: A website publishing technology based on feed syndication, developed by Yandex. Turbo pages were introduced in 2017. ℹ︎&nbsp;[tech.yandex.com/turbo](https://tech.yandex.com/turbo/)

Type
: An attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the data is intended to be used. Most programming languages support basic data types of integer numbers (of varying sizes), Floating-point numbers (which approximate real numbers), characters, and Booleans. A data type constrains the values that an expression, such as a variable or a function, might take. This data type defines the operations that can be done on the data, the meaning of the data, and the way values of that type can be stored. A data type provides a set of values from which an expression (i.e., variable, function, etc.) may take its values.&nbsp;[†](#w-data-type)

Type coercion
: → Type conversion

Type conversion
: A way of changing an expression from one data type to another. An example would be the conversion of an integer value into a floating-point value or its textual representation as a string, and vice versa. Type conversions can take advantage of certain features of type hierarchies or data representations. Two important aspects of a type conversion are whether it happens implicitly (automatically) or explicitly, and whether the underlying data representation is converted from one representation into another, or a given representation is merely reinterpreted as the representation of another data type. In general, both primitive and compound data types can be converted.&nbsp;[†](#w-type-conversion)

Type design
: The art and process of designing typefaces. Type design is often used synonymously with the term “font design”; technically, font design is the rendering of a typeface design into an entire available family of keyboardable characters, while typeface design is the shaping of individual glyphs, albeit with an eye to the eventual incorporation as a font.&nbsp;[†](#w-type-design)

Type I error
: → False positive

Type II error
: → False negative

Type system
: A set of rules that assigns a type property to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions, or modules. These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types, data structures, or other components. The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or as a combination of both. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing business rules, enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for multiple dispatch, providing a form of documentation, etc.&nbsp;[†](#w-type-system)

Typeface
: The overall design of lettering, whose design can include variations, such as extra bold, bold, regular, light, italic, condensed, extended, etc. Each of these variations of the typeface is a font. Every typeface is a collection of glyphs, each of which represents an individual letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbol. A typeface is not to be confused with a font; before the advent of digital typography and desktop publishing, the two terms had more clearly understood meanings.&nbsp;[†](#w-typeface)

TypeScript
: A programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client- and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno). The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. TypeScript was first released in 2012.&nbsp;[†](#w-typescript) ℹ︎&nbsp;[typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Typography
: The art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). Typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as a decorative device, unrelated to communication of information. Until the Digital Age, typography was a specialized occupation.&nbsp;[†](#w-typography)
