Typeface

Every typeface is a collection of glyphs, each of which represents an individual letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbol. Not to be confused with a font; before the advent of digital typography and desktop publishing, the two terms had more clearly understood meanings.&nbsp;[†](#w-typeface)
