Palpable content
: Content that makes an element non-empty by providing either some descendant non-empty text, or else something users can hear (`audio` elements) or view (`video`, `img`, or `canvas` elements), or otherwise interact with (for example, interactive form controls). That elements whose content model allows any flow content or phrasing content should have at least one node in its contents that is palpable (and that does not have the `hidden` attribute specified) is not a hard requirement.&nbsp;§

Parameter
: A special kind of variable used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine. These pieces of data are the values of the arguments (often called actual arguments or actual parameters) with which the subroutine is going to be called or invoked.&nbsp;[†](#w-parameter-argument)

Portal
: A specially designed website that brings information from diverse sources, like emails, online forums and search engines, together in a uniform way. Usually, each information source gets its dedicated area on the page for displaying information (a portlet); often, the user can configure which ones to display. Variants of portals include mashups and intranet “dashboards” for executives and managers.&nbsp;[†](#w-portal)

Programming language
: A formal language which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference.&nbsp;[†](#w-programming-language)

Property
: @@
: In programming, a special sort of class member, intermediate in functionality between a field (or data member) and a method. The syntax for reading and writing of properties is like for fields, but property reads and writes are (usually) translated to “getter” and “setter” method calls. The field-like syntax is easier to read and write than lots of method calls, yet the interposition of method calls "under the hood" allows for data validation, active updating (e.g., of GUI elements), or implementation of what may be called "read-only fields."&nbsp;[†](#w-property-programming)
