Palpable content
: Content that makes an element non-empty by providing either some descendant non-empty text, or else something users can hear (`audio` elements) or view (`video`, `img`, or `canvas` elements), or otherwise interact with (for example, interactive form controls). That elements whose content model allows any flow content or phrasing content should have at least one node in its contents that is palpable (and that does not have the `hidden` attribute specified) is not a hard requirement.&nbsp;§

Programming language
: A formal language which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference.&nbsp;[†](#w-programming-language)
