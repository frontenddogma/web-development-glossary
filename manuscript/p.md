Packed
: A property of an array that consists only of elements, and that can be optimized accordingly.

Packet
: A formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. A packet consists of control information and user data, which is also known as the payload. Control information provides data for delivering the payload, for example: source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers.&nbsp;[†](#w-packet)

Padding
: Per the CSS box model, the (width of the) padding area of a box, that is, an element on a web page. The padding area lies between the content and border areas of a box.

Page prediction
: A browser feature or script which, when enabled, tells the browser to download resources the user is likely to visit before any user requests for the content are made. Page prediction improves performance by enabling almost instant loading of predicted content. However, page prediction may also download content a user does not request.&nbsp;[‡](#m-page-prediction)

Page Quality
: Custom quality criteria for web pages (Google) and Facebook Pages (Facebook).

Pageview
: A request to load a single HTML file (web page) of an Internet site. On the World Wide Web, a page request would result from a web surfer clicking on a link on another “page” pointing to the page in question.&nbsp;[†](#w-pageview)

Pair programming
: An agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. While reviewing, the observer also considers the “strategic” direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the “tactical” aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.&nbsp;[†](#w-pair-programming)

Palpable content
: Content that makes an element non-empty by providing either some descendant non-empty text, or else something users can hear (`audio` elements) or view (`video`, `img`, or `canvas` elements), or otherwise interact with (for example, interactive form controls). That elements whose content model allows any flow content or phrasing content should have at least one node in its contents that is palpable (and that does not have the `hidden` attribute specified) is not a hard requirement.&nbsp;§

Paradigm
: A distinct set of concepts or thought patterns, including theories, research methods, postulates, and standards for what constitutes legitimate contributions to a field. According to Thomas Kuhn (1962), scientific paradigms are “universally recognized scientific achievements that, for a time, provide model problems and solutions for a community of practitioners.”&nbsp;[†](#w-paradigm)

Parallax scrolling
: A technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene and adding to the sense of immersion in the virtual experience. The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1930s.&nbsp;[†](#w-parallax-scrolling)

Parameter
: A special kind of variable used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine. These pieces of data are the values of the arguments (often called actual arguments or actual parameters) with which the subroutine is going to be called or invoked.&nbsp;[†](#w-parameter-argument)

Pareto Principle
: The observation that for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. It is named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noted the 80/20 connection in 1896, as published in his first work, _Cours d’économie politique_. In it, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. It is a similar axiom of business management that “80% of sales come from 20% of clients.”&nbsp;[†](#w-pareto-principle)

Parkinson’s Law
: The idea that work expands so to fill the time available for its completion. It is sometimes applied to the growth of bureaucracy in an organization. It was stated in 1955 by Cyril Northcote Parkinson in an essay published in _The Economist_. A popular corollary is that “Work contracts to fit in the time we give it.”&nbsp;[†](#w-parkinsons-law)

Parsing
: The process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages or data structures, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar. The term parsing comes from Latin _pars_ (_orationis_), meaning “part (of speech)”. The term has slightly different meanings in different branches of linguistics and computer science. Within computational linguistics “parsing” is used to refer to the formal analysis by a computer of a sentence or other string of words into its constituents, resulting in a parse tree showing their syntactic relation to each other, which may also contain semantic and other information.&nbsp;[†](#w-parsing)

Parser
: A software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data structure—often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree, or other hierarchical structure, giving a structural representation of the input while checking for correct syntax. The parsing may be preceded or followed by other steps, or these may be combined into a single step. The parser is often preceded by a separate lexical analyser, which creates tokens from the sequence of input characters; alternatively, these can be combined in scannerless parsing. Parsers may be programmed by hand or may be automatically or semi-automatically generated by a parser generator. Parsing is complementary to templating, which produces formatted output.&nbsp;[†](#w-parsing)

Patch
: A set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, like around functionality, usability, or performance. Patches are also called bugfixes (or bug fixes).&nbsp;[†](#w-patch)

Polyfill
: Code that implements a feature on web browsers that do not support the feature. Most often, it refers to a JavaScript library that implements an HTML web standard, either an established standard (supported by some browsers) on older browsers, or a proposed standard (not supported by any browsers) on existing browsers. Formally, “a polyfill is a shim for a browser API.” Polyfills allow web developers to use an API regardless of whether or not it is supported by a browser, and usually with minimal overhead.&nbsp;[†](#w-polyfill)

Portal
: A specially designed website that brings information from diverse sources, like emails, online forums and search engines, together in a uniform way. Usually, each information source gets its dedicated area on the page for displaying information (a portlet); often, the user can configure which ones to display. Variants of portals include mashups and intranet “dashboards” for executives and managers.&nbsp;[†](#w-portal)

Product Owner

Programming language
: A formal language which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference.&nbsp;[†](#w-programming-language)

Property
: @@
: In programming, a special sort of class member, intermediate in functionality between a field (or data member) and a method. The syntax for reading and writing of properties is like for fields, but property reads and writes are (usually) translated to “getter” and “setter” method calls. The field-like syntax is easier to read and write than lots of method calls, yet the interposition of method calls “under the hood” allows for data validation, active updating (e.g., of GUI elements), or implementation of what may be called “read-only fields.”&nbsp;[†](#w-property-programming)
