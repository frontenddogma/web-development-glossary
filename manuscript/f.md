Fallback
: A contingency option to be taken if the preferred choice is unavailable.&nbsp;[†](#w-fallback)

Falsy
: A value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context, which is relevant notably with JavaScript which uses type conversion to coerce any value to a Boolean in contexts that require it, such as conditionals and loops.&nbsp;[‡](#m-falsy)

Favicon
: A file containing one or more small icons, associated with a particular website or web page. Browsers that provide favicon support typically display a page’s favicon in the browser’s address bar (sometimes in the history as well) and next to the page’s name in a list of bookmarks. Browsers that support a tabbed document interface typically show a page’s favicon next to the page’s title on the tab, and site-specific browsers use the favicon as a desktop icon.&nbsp;[†](#w-favicon)

Feed
: A data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. Content distributors syndicate a web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe a channel to it by adding the feed resource address to news aggregator client (also called a feed reader or a news reader). Users typically subscribe to a feed by manually entering the URL of a feed or clicking a link in a web browser or by dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator. The kinds of content delivered by a web feed are typically HTML (webpage content) or links to webpages and other kinds of digital media.&nbsp;[†](#w-feed)

File Transfer Protocol
: A standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. FTP was not designed to be a secure protocol, and has many security weaknesses.&nbsp;[†](#w-ftp)

Firefox
: A cross-platform web browser. Firefox was developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla Corporation, and first released in 2002, named Phoenix. 🌍&nbsp;[mozilla.org/firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/)

First Contentful Paint
: The time when the browser renders the first bit of content from the DOM, providing the first feedback to the user that the page is actually loading. The question “Is it happening?” is “yes” when the first contentful paint completes.&nbsp;[‡](#m-fcp)

First CPU Idle
: The time when a page is minimally interactive, or when the window is quiet enough to handle user input. It is a non-standard Google web performance metric. Generally, it occurs when most, but not necessarily all of visible UI elements are interactive, and the user interface responds, on average, to most user input within 50&nbsp;ms.&nbsp;[‡](#m-first-cpu-idle)

First Meaningful Paint
: The paint after which the biggest above-the-fold layout change has happened and web fonts have loaded. It is when the answer to “Is it useful?” becomes “yes,” upon first meaningful paint completion.&nbsp;[‡](#m-fmp)

First Paint
: The time between navigation and when the browser render the first pixels to the screen, rendering anything that is visually different from what was on the screen prior to navigation. It answers the question "is it happening?"&nbsp;[‡](#m-first-paint)

Fitts’ Law
: A predictive model of human movement primarily used in human–computer interaction and ergonomics. This scientific law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target. Fitts’ Law is used to model the act of pointing, either by physically touching an object with a hand or finger, or virtually, by pointing to an object on a computer monitor using a pointing device. Fitts' Law has been shown to apply under a variety of conditions.&nbsp;[†](#w-fitts-law)

Fixed
: A web design approach in which page elements have a fixed as opposed to variable width. Outdated with the popularity of mobile devices and the concept of responsive design.

Flash
: A deprecated multimedia software platform used for production of animations, rich Internet applications, desktop applications, mobile applications, mobile games, and embedded web browser video players. Flash displays text, vector graphics, and raster graphics to provide animations, video games and applications. It allows streaming of audio and video, and can capture mouse, keyboard, microphone and camera input.&nbsp;[†](#w-flash)

Flash of Faux Text
: The minimized effect when a browser switches from a fallback font to a particular web font before loading and applying yet other fonts.

Flash of Invisible Text
: The effect when a browser hides text until respective web font is loaded, possibly leading to invisible content.

Flash of Unstyled Content
: → Flash of Unstyled Text

Flash of Unstyled Text
: The effect when a web page appears briefly with the browser's default styles prior to loading an external style sheet, due to the web browser engine rendering the page before all information is retrieved. The page corrects itself as soon as the style rules are loaded and applied; however, the shift may be distracting.&nbsp;[†](#w-fout)

Flash Player
: A software for using content created on the Adobe Flash platform, including viewing multimedia contents, executing rich Internet applications, and streaming audio and video. Flash Player can run from a web browser as a browser plug-in or on supported mobile devices. Flash Player was created by Macromedia and has been developed and distributed by Adobe Systems since Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005. In July 2017, Adobe announced that it would end support for Flash Player at the end of 2020, and continued to encourage the use of open HTML5 standards in place of Flash.&nbsp;[†](#w-flash-player)

Flex
: A new value (`flex`) added to the CSS `display` property. Along with `inline-flex` it causes the element that it applies to to become a flex container, and the element's children to each become a flex item. The items then participate in flex layout, and all of the properties defined in the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module may be applied.&nbsp;[‡](#m-flex)
: → Flexbox

Flexbox
: A CSS web layout model for displaying items in a single dimension, as a row or as a column. In the specification for the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module, Flexbox is described as a layout model for user interface design. The key feature of Flexbox is the fact that items in a flex layout can grow and shrink. Space can be assigned to the items themselves, or distributed between or around the items. Flexbox also enables alignment of items on the main or cross axis, thus providing a high level of control over the size and alignment of a group of items.&nbsp;[‡](#m-flexbox) 🌍&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/)

Folksonomy
: The system in which users apply public tags to online items, typically to make those items easier for themselves or others to find later. Over time, this can give rise to a classification system based on those tags and how often they are applied or searched for, in contrast to a taxonomic classification designed by the owners of the content and specified when it is published. This practice is also known as collaborative tagging, social classification, social indexing, and social tagging.&nbsp;[†](#w-folksonomy)
