# F

Fallback
: A contingency option to be taken if the preferred choice is unavailable.&nbsp;[†](#w-fallback)

Falsy
: A value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context, which is relevant notably with JavaScript which uses type conversion to coerce any value to a Boolean in contexts that require it, such as conditionals and loops.&nbsp;[‡](#m-falsy)

Favicon
: A file containing one or more small icons, associated with a particular website or web page. Browsers that provide favicon support typically display a page’s favicon in the browser’s address bar (sometimes in the history as well) and next to the page’s name in a list of bookmarks. Browsers that support a tabbed document interface typically show a page’s favicon next to the page’s title on the tab, and site-specific browsers use the favicon as a desktop icon.&nbsp;[†](#w-favicon)

Feed
: A data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. Content distributors syndicate a web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe a channel to it by adding the feed resource address to news aggregator client (also called a feed reader or a news reader). Users typically subscribe to a feed by manually entering the URL of a feed or clicking a link in a web browser or by dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator. The kinds of content delivered by a web feed are typically HTML (webpage content) or links to webpages and other kinds of digital media.&nbsp;[†](#w-feed)

File Transfer Protocol
: A standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. FTP was not designed to be a secure protocol, and has many security weaknesses.&nbsp;[†](#w-ftp)

Firefox
: A cross-platform web browser. Firefox was developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla Corporation, and first released in 2002, named Phoenix. 🌍&nbsp;[mozilla.org/firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/)

First Contentful Paint
: The time when the browser renders the first bit of content from the DOM, providing the first feedback to the user that the page is actually loading. The question “Is it happening?” is “yes” when the first contentful paint completes.&nbsp;[‡](#m-fcp)

First CPU Idle
: The time when a page is minimally interactive, or when the window is quiet enough to handle user input. It is a non-standard Google web performance metric. Generally, it occurs when most, but not necessarily all of visible UI elements are interactive, and the user interface responds, on average, to most user input within 50&nbsp;ms.&nbsp;[‡](#m-first-cpu-idle)

First Meaningful Paint
: The paint after which the biggest above-the-fold layout change has happened and web fonts have loaded. It is when the answer to “Is it useful?” becomes “yes,” upon first meaningful paint completion.&nbsp;[‡](#m-fmp)
