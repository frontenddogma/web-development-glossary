Fallback
: A contingency option to be taken if the preferred choice is unavailable.&nbsp;[†](#w-fallback)

Falsy
: A value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context, which is relevant notably with JavaScript which uses type conversion to coerce any value to a Boolean in contexts that require it, such as conditionals and loops.&nbsp;[‡](#m-falsy)

Favicon
: A file containing one or more small icons, associated with a particular website or web page. Browsers that provide favicon support typically display a page’s favicon in the browser’s address bar (sometimes in the history as well) and next to the page’s name in a list of bookmarks. Browsers that support a tabbed document interface typically show a page’s favicon next to the page’s title on the tab, and site-specific browsers use the favicon as a desktop icon.&nbsp;[†](#w-favicon)

Feed
: A data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. Content distributors syndicate a web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe a channel to it by adding the feed resource address to news aggregator client (also called a feed reader or a news reader). Users typically subscribe to a feed by manually entering the URL of a feed or clicking a link in a web browser or by dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator. The kinds of content delivered by a web feed are typically HTML (webpage content) or links to webpages and other kinds of digital media.&nbsp;[†](#w-feed)

File
: A computer resource for recording data discretely in a computer storage device. Just as words can be written to paper, so can information be written to a computer file.&nbsp;[†](#w-file)

File Manager
: A computer program that provides a user interface to manage files and folders. The most common operations performed on files or groups of files include creating, opening (e.g. viewing, playing, editing, or printing), renaming, moving or copying, deleting and searching for files, as well as modifying file attributes, properties and file permissions.&nbsp;[†](#w-file-manager)

File system
: A software that controls how data is stored and retrieved. Without a file system, data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins. Taking its name from the way paper-based data management system is named, each group of data is called a “file.” There are many different kinds of file systems. Each one has different structure and logic, properties of speed, flexibility, security, or size.&nbsp;[†](#w-fs)

File Transfer Protocol
: A standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. FTP was not designed to be a secure protocol, and has many security weaknesses.&nbsp;[†](#w-ftp)

Firebird
: → Firefox

Firefox
: A cross-platform web browser. Firefox was developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla Corporation, and first released in 2002, named Phoenix. ℹ︎&nbsp;[mozilla.org/firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/)

First Contentful Paint
: The time when the browser renders the first bit of content from the DOM, providing the first feedback to the user that the page is actually loading. The question “Is it happening?” is “yes” when the first contentful paint completes.&nbsp;[‡](#m-fcp)

First CPU Idle
: The time when a page is minimally interactive, or when the window is quiet enough to handle user input. It is a non-standard Google web performance metric. Generally, it occurs when most, but not necessarily all of visible UI elements are interactive, and the user interface responds, on average, to most user input within 50&nbsp;ms.&nbsp;[‡](#m-first-cpu-idle)

First In, First Out
: A method for organising and manipulating a data buffer, where the oldest (first) entry, or “head” of the queue, is processed first. It is analogous to processing a queue with first-come, first-served (FCFS) behaviour: where the people leave the queue in the order in which they arrive.&nbsp;[†](#w-fifo)

First Input Delay
: The time from when a user first interacts with a site (i.e. when they click a link, tap on a button, or uses a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to respond to that interaction. It is the length of time, in milliseconds, between the first user interaction on a web page and the browsers response to that interaction. Scrolling and zooming are not included in this metric.&nbsp;[‡](#m-fid)

First Interactive
: → First CPU Idle

First Meaningful Paint
: The paint after which the biggest above-the-fold layout change has happened and web fonts have loaded. It is when the answer to “Is it useful?” becomes “yes,” upon first meaningful paint completion.&nbsp;[‡](#m-fmp)

First Paint
: The time between navigation and when the browser render the first pixels to the screen, rendering anything that is visually different from what was on the screen prior to navigation. It answers the question “is it happening?”&nbsp;[‡](#m-first-paint)

First-Class Function
: A function that is treated like any other variable in respective language.&nbsp;[‡](#m-first-class-function)

: → First-Class Function

Fitts’ Law
: A predictive model of human movement primarily used in human-computer interaction and ergonomics. This scientific law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target. Fitts’ Law is used to model the act of pointing, either by physically touching an object with a hand or finger, or virtually, by pointing to an object on a computer monitor using a pointing device. Fitts’ Law has been shown to apply under a variety of conditions.&nbsp;[†](#w-fitts-law)

Fixed
: A web design approach in which page elements have a fixed as opposed to a variable width. Outdated with the popularity of mobile devices and the concept of responsive design.

Flash
: A deprecated multimedia software platform used for production of animations, rich Internet applications, desktop applications, mobile applications, mobile games, and embedded web browser video players. Flash displays text, vector graphics, and raster graphics to provide animations, video games and applications. It allows streaming of audio and video, and can capture mouse, keyboard, microphone and camera input.&nbsp;[†](#w-flash)

Flash of Faux Text
: The minimized effect when a browser switches from a fallback font to a particular web font before loading and applying yet other fonts.

Flash of Invisible Text
: The effect when a browser hides text until respective web font is loaded, possibly leading to invisible content.

Flash of Unstyled Content
: → Flash of Unstyled Text

Flash of Unstyled Text
: The effect when a web page appears briefly with the browser’s default styles prior to loading an external style sheet, due to the web browser engine rendering the page before all information is retrieved. The page corrects itself as soon as the style rules are loaded and applied; however, the shift may be distracting.&nbsp;[†](#w-fout)

Flash Player
: A software for using content created on the Adobe Flash platform, including viewing multimedia contents, executing rich Internet applications, and streaming audio and video. Flash Player can run from a web browser as a browser plug-in or on supported mobile devices. Flash Player was created by Macromedia and has been developed and distributed by Adobe Systems since Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005. In 2017, Adobe announced that it would end support for Flash Player at the end of 2020, and continued to encourage the use of open HTML5 standards in place of Flash.&nbsp;[†](#w-flash-player)

Flex
: A new value (`flex`) added to the CSS `display` property. Along with `inline-flex` it causes the element that it applies to to become a flex container, and the element’s children to each become a flex item. The items then participate in flex layout, and all of the properties defined in the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module may be applied.&nbsp;[‡](#m-flex)
: → Flexbox

Flexbox
: A CSS web layout model for displaying items in a single dimension, as a row or as a column. In the specification for the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module, Flexbox is described as a layout model for user interface design. The key feature of Flexbox is the fact that items in a flex layout can grow and shrink. Space can be assigned to the items themselves, or distributed between or around the items. Flexbox also enables alignment of items on the main or cross axis, thus providing a high level of control over the size and alignment of a group of items.&nbsp;[‡](#m-flexbox) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/)

Float
: A single precision, 32-bit floating-point data type.
: A mechanism for visual formatting in CSS building on the `float` property, allowing content to flow along an element’s sides.

Flock
: A discontinued web browser that specialized in providing social networking and Web 2.0 facilities built into its user interface. Flock was released in 2005 and discontinued in 2011.&nbsp;[†](#w-flock)

Fluent Design System
: A design language developed in 2017 by Microsoft. Fluent Design is a revamp of Microsoft Design Language 2 that includes guidelines for the designs and interactions used within software designed for all Windows 10 devices and platforms. The system is based on five key components: Light, Depth, Motion, Material, and Scale. The new design language includes more prominent use of motion, depth, and translucency effects.&nbsp;[†](#w-fluent-design)

Folksonomy
: The system in which users apply public tags to online items, typically to make those items easier for themselves or others to find later. Over time, this can give rise to a classification system based on those tags and how often they are applied or searched for, in contrast to a taxonomic classification designed by the owners of the content and specified when it is published. This practice is also known as collaborative tagging, social classification, social indexing, and social tagging.&nbsp;[†](#w-folksonomy)

Font
: With the advent of digital typography, “font” is frequently synonymous with “typeface.” Each style is in a separate font file—for instance, the typeface Bulmer may include the fonts “Bulmer roman,” “Bulmer,” “Bulmer bold” and “Bulmer extended,” but the term “font” might be applied either to one of these alone or to the whole typeface. In both traditional typesetting and modern usage, “font” also refers to the delivery mechanism of the typeface design. In traditional typesetting, a font would be made from metal or wood. Today, the font is a digital file.&nbsp;[†](#w-font)

Fork
: The taking of a copy of source code from one software package and starting independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. A fork often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community, a form of schism.&nbsp;[†](#w-fork)

Form
: An interface that allows to enter data that is sent to a server for processing. Forms can resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the forms using checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields. In HTML, forms are set up using the `form` and related elements.&nbsp;[†](#w-form)

Formatting context
: A concept that governs how boxes are laid out with CSS. There are different formatting contexts, like block formatting context, inline formatting context, and table formatting context.

FPS
: → Frames per Second

Fragment identifier
: A string of characters that refers to a resource that is subordinate to another, primary resource. The primary resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), and the fragment identifier points to the subordinate resource. The fragment identifier introduced by a hash mark (`#`) is the optional last part of a URL for a document. It is typically used to identify a portion of that document. The hash mark separator in URIs is not part of the fragment identifier.&nbsp;[†](#w-fragment-identifier)

Frame
: A part of a web page or browser window which displays content independent of its container, with the ability to load content independently. The HTML or media elements shown in a frame may come from a different web site as the other elements of content on display, although this practice, known as framing, is today often regarded as a violation of same-origin policy and has been considered a form of copyright infringement.&nbsp;[†](#w-frame)

Frame rate
: The frequency (rate) at which consecutive images called frames appear on a display. The term applies equally to film and video cameras, computer graphics, and motion capture systems. Frame rate may also be called the frame frequency, and be expressed in Hertz.&nbsp;[†](#w-frame-rate)

Frameset
: A group of named frames to which web pages and media can be directed.&nbsp;[†](#w-frame)

Free and Open Source Software
: Software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software. That is, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software. This is in contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright licensing and the source code is usually hidden from the users.&nbsp;[†](#w-foss)

Free Software Foundation
: A non-profit organization founded by Richard Stallman in 1985 to support the free software movement, which promotes the universal freedom to study, distribute, create, and modify computer software, with the organization’s preference for software being distributed under copyleft (“share alike”) terms, such as with its own GNU General Public License. The FSF was incorporated in Massachusetts, U.S., where it is also based.&nbsp;[†](#w-fsf) ℹ︎&nbsp;[fsf.org](https://www.fsf.org/)

Frontend
: The presentation layer of a piece of software, usually an abstraction that simplifies the underlying component by providing a user-friendly interface. In the client-server model, the client is considered the front end, even when some presentation work is actually done on the server itself.&nbsp;[†](#w-frontend-backend)

FrontPage
: A discontinued WYSIWYG HTML editor and website administration tool from Microsoft for the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. It was branded as part of the Microsoft Office suite from 1997 to 2003. Microsoft FrontPage has since been replaced by Microsoft Expression Web and SharePoint Designer, which were first released in 2006 alongside Microsoft Office 2007, but these two products were also discontinued.&nbsp;[†](#w-frontpage)

Full stack developer
: A developer who can handle all aspects of website or web application development, that is, including both frontend and backend development.
: A developer who masters a particular solution stack.

Function
: A code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function. When a function is called, arguments are passed to the function as input, and the function can optionally return a value. A function in JavaScript is also an object. A function name is an identifier included as part of a function declaration or function expression. The function name’s scope depends on whether the function name is a declaration or expression.&nbsp;[‡](#m-function)

Function binding
: The creating of a new function using the `bind()` method.

Functional testing
: A quality assurance (QA) process and a type of black-box testing that bases its test cases on the specifications of the software component under test. Functions are tested by feeding them input and examining the output, and internal program structure is rarely considered (unlike white-box testing). Functional testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements. Functional testing usually describes _what_ the system does.&nbsp;[†](#w-functional-testing)
