K-Meleon
: A web browser for Microsoft Windows based on the Gecko layout engine. K-Meleon was first released in 2000.&nbsp;[†](#w-k-meleon) ℹ︎&nbsp;[kmeleonbrowser.org](http://kmeleonbrowser.org/)

Kanban
: A lean method to manage and improve work. Kanban aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity, and by improving the handling of system-level bottlenecks. Work items are visualized to give participants a view of progress and process, from start to finish, usually via a Kanban board. Work is pulled as capacity permits, rather than work being pushed into the process when requested.&nbsp;[†](#w-kanban)

Kebab case
: A case style in which punctuation is removed and spaces are replaced by single hyphens (“the-quick-brown-fox”). Usually the letters share the same case.&nbsp;[†](#w-letter-case)

Kerberos
: A network authentication protocol that works on the basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. The protocol was named after the character Kerberos (or Cerberus) from Greek mythology. Its designers aimed Kerberos primarily at a client-server model for which it provides mutual authentication—both the user and the server verify each other’s identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping and replay attacks.&nbsp;[†](#w-kerberos) ℹ︎&nbsp;[web.mit.edu/kerberos](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/)

Kerning
: The process of adjusting the spacing between characters in a proportional font, usually to achieve a visually pleasing result. Kerning adjusts the space between individual letter forms, while tracking (letter spacing) adjusts spacing uniformly over a range of characters. In a well-kerned font, the two-dimensional blank spaces between each pair of characters all have a visually similar area. The related term “kern” denotes a part of a type letter that overhangs the edge of the type block.&nbsp;[†](#w-kerning)

Key
: In cryptography, a piece of information (a parameter) that determines the functional output of a cryptographic algorithm. For encryption algorithms, a key specifies the transformation of plain-text into ciphertext, and vice versa for decryption algorithms.&nbsp;[†](#w-key-cryptography)

Key Performance Indicator
: A type of performance measurement. KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity (such as projects, programs, products, and other initiatives) in which it engages. Choosing the right KPIs relies upon a good understanding of what is important to the organization. What is deemed important often depends on the business department measuring the performance.&nbsp;[†](#w-kpi)

Key-value database
: A data storage paradigm designed for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays, and a data structure more commonly known today as a dictionary or hash table. Dictionaries contain a collection of objects, or records, which in turn have many different fields within them, each containing data. These records are stored and retrieved using a key that uniquely identifies the record, and is used to find the data within the database.&nbsp;[†](#w-key-value-database)

Keyword
: A reserved word (also known as a reserved identifier) is a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or label—it is “reserved from use.” This is a syntactic definition, and a reserved word may have no meaning.&nbsp;[†](#w-keyword)

KHTML
: A browser engine developed by the KDE project. KHTML is the engine used by the Konqueror web browser. Although it has not seen significant development since 2016, it is still actively maintained.

Knowledge Graph
: A knowledge base used by Google and its services to enhance its search engine’s results with information gathered from a variety of sources. The information is presented to users in an info box next to search results. Knowledge Graph info boxes were added to Google’s search engine in 2012, starting in the United States. The information covered by the Knowledge Graph grew significantly after launch (covering 570 million entities and 18 billion facts), answering roughly one third of the 100 billion monthly searches Google processed in 2016.&nbsp;[†](#w-knowledge-graph)

Konqueror
: A web browser and file management tool. Konqueror was first released in 1996. ℹ︎&nbsp;[konqueror.org](https://konqueror.org/)

Kubernetes
: An container orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. Kubernetes was originally designed by Google, first released in 2014, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.&nbsp;[†](#w-k8s) ℹ︎&nbsp;[kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/)
