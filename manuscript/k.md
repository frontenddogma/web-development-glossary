K-Meleon
: A web browser for Microsoft Windows based on the Gecko layout engine like Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey. K-Meleon was first released in 2000.&nbsp;[†](#w-k-meleon) ℹ︎&nbsp;[kmeleonbrowser.org](http://kmeleonbrowser.org/)

Kanban
: A lean method to manage and improve work. Kanban aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity, and by improving the handling of system-level bottlenecks. Work items are visualized to give participants a view of progress and process, from start to finish—usually via a Kanban board. Work is pulled as capacity permits, rather than work being pushed into the process when requested.&nbsp;[†](#w-kanban)

Kerberos
: A computer-network authentication protocol that works on the basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. The protocol was named after the character Kerberos (or Cerberus) from Greek mythology. Its designers aimed Kerberos primarily at a client-server model and it provides mutual authentication—both the user and the server verify each other’s identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping and replay attacks.&nbsp;[†](#w-kerberos)

Key
: In cryptography, a piece of information (a parameter) that determines the functional output of a cryptographic algorithm. For encryption algorithms, a key specifies the transformation of plaintext into ciphertext, and vice versa for decryption algorithms.&nbsp;[†](#w-key-cryptography)

Key Performance Indicator
: A type of performance measurement. KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity (such as projects, programs, products and other initiatives) in which it engages. Choosing the right KPIs relies upon a good understanding of what is important to the organization. What is deemed important often also depends on the department measuring the performance.&nbsp;[†](#w-kpi)

Key-value database
: A data storage paradigm designed for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays, and a data structure more commonly known today as a dictionary or hash table. Dictionaries contain a collection of objects, or records, which in turn have many different fields within them, each containing data. These records are stored and retrieved using a key that uniquely identifies the record, and is used to find the data within the database.&nbsp;[†](#w-key-value-database)

Keyword
: A reserved word (also known as a reserved identifier) is a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or label—it is “reserved from use.” This is a syntactic definition, and a reserved word may have no meaning.&nbsp;[†](#w-keyword)

KHTML
: A browser engine developed by the KDE project. It is the engine used by the Konqueror web browser. Although it has not seen significant development since 2016, it is still actively maintained.

Konqueror
: A web browser and file management tool. Konqueror was first released in 1996. ℹ︎&nbsp;[konqueror.org](https://konqueror.org/)
