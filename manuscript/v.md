Virtual inheritance
: A C++ technique that ensures only one copy of a base class’s member variables are inherited by grandchild derived classes. Without virtual inheritance, if two classes `B` and `C` inherit from a class `A`, and a class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`, then `D` will contain two copies of `A`’s member variables: one via `B`, and one via `C`. These will be accessible independently, using scope resolution. Instead, if classes `B` and `C` inherit virtually from class `A`, then objects of class `D` will contain only one set of the member variables from class `A`. This feature is most useful for multiple inheritance, as it makes the virtual base a common subobject for the deriving class and all classes that are derived from it.&nbsp;[†](#w-virtual-inheritance)
