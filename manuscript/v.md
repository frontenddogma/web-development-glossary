Virtual inheritance
: A C++ technique that ensures only one copy of a base class’s member variables are inherited by grandchild derived classes. Without virtual inheritance, if two classes `B` and `C` inherit from a class `A`, and a class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`, then `D` will contain two copies of `A`’s member variables: one via `B`, and one via `C`. These will be accessible independently, using scope resolution. Instead, if classes `B` and `C` inherit virtually from class `A`, then objects of class `D` will contain only one set of the member variables from class `A`. This feature is most useful for multiple inheritance, as it makes the virtual base a common subobject for the deriving class and all classes that are derived from it.&nbsp;[†](#w-virtual-inheritance)

Visual Basic for Applications
: An implementation of Microsoft’s event-driven programming language Visual Basic 6, which was declared legacy in 2008, and its associated integrated development environment (IDE). Although pre-.NET Visual Basic is no longer supported or updated by Microsoft, the VBA programming language was upgraded in 2010 with the introduction of Visual Basic for Applications 7 in Microsoft Office applications. Visual Basic for Applications enables building user-defined functions (UDFs), automating processes, and accessing Windows API and other low-level functionality through dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). It supersedes and expands on the abilities of earlier application-specific macro programming languages such as Word’s WordBASIC. VBA was first released in 1993.&nbsp;[†](#w-vba)

VoiceOver
: A screen reader built into Apple Inc.’s macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and iPod operating systems. By using VoiceOver, the user can access their Macintosh or iOS device based on spoken descriptions and, in the case of the Mac, the keyboard. The feature is designed to increase accessibility for blind and low-vision users, as well as for users with dyslexia.&nbsp;[†](#w-voiceover) ℹ︎&nbsp;[apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/)
