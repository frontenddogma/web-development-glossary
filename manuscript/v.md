Validation
: The process of ensuring data have undergone data cleansing to ensure they have data quality, that is, that they are both correct and useful. Validation uses routines, often called “validation rules,” “validation constraints,” or “check routines,” that check for correctness, meaningfulness, and security of data that are input to the system. The rules may be implemented through the automated facilities of a data dictionary, or by the inclusion of explicit application program validation logic of the computer and its application.&nbsp;[†](#w-validation)

Validator
: A software used to check the validity or syntactical correctness of a fragment of code or document. The term is commonly used in the context of validating HTML, CSS, or XML documents like RSS feeds, though a validator can be used for any defined format or language.&nbsp;[†](#w-validator)

Value
: The representation of some entity that can be manipulated by a program. The members of a type are the values of that type. In declarative (high-level) languages, values have to be referentially transparent.&nbsp;[†](#w-value)

Variable
: A storage address (identified by a memory address) paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of program execution.&nbsp;[†](#w-variable)

Vector image
: An image defined in terms of 2D points, which are connected by lines and curves to form polygons and other shapes. Each of these points has a definite position on the x- and y-axis of the work plane and determines the direction of the path; further, each path may have various properties including values for stroke color, shape, curve, thickness, and fill. Vector graphics are commonly found today in the SVG, EPS, PDF, or AI graphic file formats and are intrinsically different from the more common raster graphics file formats such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and MPEG4.&nbsp;[†](#w-vector-image)

Velocity
: A metric for work done, which is often used in agile software development. The velocity metric is used for planning sprints and measuring team performance, though there is no evidence that measuring velocity improves planning effectiveness or team performance.&nbsp;[†](#w-velocity)

Versioning
: The process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of computer software. Within a given version number category (major, minor), these numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments in the software. At a fine-grained level, revision control is often used for keeping track of incrementally different versions of information, whether or not this information is computer software. Modern computer software is often tracked using two different software versioning schemes—internal version number that may be incremented many times in a single day, such as a revision control number, and a released version that typically changes far less often, such as semantic versioning or a project code name.&nbsp;[†](#w-versioning)

Virtual inheritance
: A C++ technique that ensures only one copy of a base class’s member variables are inherited by grandchild derived classes. Without virtual inheritance, if two classes `B` and `C` inherit from a class `A`, and a class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`, then `D` will contain two copies of `A`’s member variables: one via `B`, and one via `C`. These will be accessible independently, using scope resolution. Instead, if classes `B` and `C` inherit virtually from class `A`, then objects of class `D` will contain only one set of the member variables from class `A`. This feature is most useful for multiple inheritance, as it makes the virtual base a common subobject for the deriving class and all classes that are derived from it.&nbsp;[†](#w-virtual-inheritance)

Virtualization
: The act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources. Virtualization began in the 1960s, as a method of logically dividing the system resources provided by mainframe computers between different applications. Since then, the meaning of the term has broadened.&nbsp;[†](#w-virtualization)

Visual Basic for Applications
: An implementation of Microsoft’s event-driven programming language Visual Basic 6, which was declared legacy in 2008, and its associated integrated development environment (IDE). Although pre-.NET Visual Basic is no longer supported or updated by Microsoft, the VBA programming language was upgraded in 2010 with the introduction of Visual Basic for Applications 7 in Microsoft Office applications. Visual Basic for Applications enables building user-defined functions (UDFs), automating processes, and accessing Windows API and other low-level functionality through dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). It supersedes and expands on the abilities of earlier application-specific macro programming languages such as Word’s WordBASIC. VBA was first released in 1993.&nbsp;[†](#w-vba)

VoiceOver
: A screen reader built into Apple Inc.’s macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and iPod operating systems. By using VoiceOver, the user can access their Macintosh or iOS device based on spoken descriptions and, in the case of the Mac, the keyboard. The feature is designed to increase accessibility for blind and low-vision users, as well as for users with dyslexia.&nbsp;[†](#w-voiceover) ℹ︎&nbsp;[apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/)
