Obfuscation
: The deliberate act of creating source or machine code that is difficult for humans to understand. Like obfuscation in natural language, it may use needlessly roundabout expressions to compose statements. Programmers may deliberately obfuscate code to conceal its purpose (security through obscurity) or its logic or implicit values embedded in it, primarily, in order to prevent tampering, deter reverse engineering, or even as a puzzle or recreational challenge for someone reading the source code.&nbsp;[†](#w-obfuscation)

Object
: A variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a value in memory referenced by an identifier. In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, an object refers to a particular instance of a class, where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures. In relational database management, an object can be a table or column, or an association between data and a database entity (such as relating a person’s age to a specific person).&nbsp;[†](#w-object)

Object-Oriented CSS
: A CSS methodology. The focus of OOCSS is the idea of treating page elements as objects, giving all these objects classes, and regarding objects’ classes as single entities in style sheets. OOCSS was presented in 2009 by Nicole Sullivan.&nbsp;[†](#w-oocss)

Object-Oriented Programming
: A programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects,” which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is an object’s procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of “this” or “self”). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.&nbsp;[†](#w-oop)

Objectives and Key Results
: A framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes. OKRs comprise an objective—a clearly defined goal—and one or more key results—specific measures used to track the achievement of that goal. The goal of OKR is to define how to achieve objectives through concrete, specific and measurable actions. Key results can be measured on a 0–100% scale or any numerical unit. The development of OKRs is generally attributed to Andy Grove, who introduced the approach to Intel and documented OKR in his 1983 book _High Output Management_. Grove’s simple but effective concept is explained by John Doerr: “The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it.”&nbsp;[†](#w-okr)
