Obfuscation
: The deliberate act of creating source or machine code that is difficult for humans to understand. Like obfuscation in natural language, it may use needlessly roundabout expressions to compose statements. Programmers may deliberately obfuscate code to conceal its purpose (security through obscurity) or its logic or implicit values embedded in it, primarily, in order to prevent tampering, deter reverse engineering, or even as a puzzle or recreational challenge for someone reading the source code.&nbsp;[†](#w-obfuscation)

Object
: A variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a value in memory referenced by an identifier. In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, an object refers to a particular instance of a class, where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures. In relational database management, an object can be a table or column, or an association between data and a database entity (such as relating a person’s age to a specific person).&nbsp;[†](#w-object)

Object-Oriented CSS
: A CSS methodology. The focus of OOCSS is the idea of treating page elements as objects, giving all these objects classes, and regarding objects’ classes as single entities in style sheets. OOCSS was presented in 2009 by Nicole Sullivan.&nbsp;[†](#w-oocss)

Object-Oriented Programming
: A programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects,” which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is an object’s procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of “this” or “self”). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.&nbsp;[†](#w-oop)

Objectives and Key Results
: A framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes. OKRs comprise an objective—a clearly defined goal—and one or more key results—specific measures used to track the achievement of that goal. The goal of OKR is to define how to achieve objectives through concrete, specific and measurable actions. Key results can be measured on a 0–100% scale or any numerical unit. The development of OKRs is generally attributed to Andy Grove, who introduced the approach to Intel and documented OKR in his 1983 book _High Output Management_. Grove’s simple but effective concept is explained by John Doerr: “The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it.”&nbsp;[†](#w-okr)

Observer pattern
: A software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems.&nbsp;[†](#w-observer-pattern)

Offline
: Being in a state of disconnection from the Internet.

Offline First
: The idea of not assuming permanent, fast Internet connectivity, and developing sites and apps so to also work with no or poor connectivity. ℹ︎&nbsp;[offlinefirst.org](http://offlinefirst.org/)

One-based indexing
: The indexing of the first element of an array by subscript of 1.&nbsp;[†](#w-array)

One-Time Password
: A password that is valid for only one login session or transaction, on a computer system or other digital device. OTPs avoid a number of shortcomings that are associated with traditional (static) password-based authentication; a number of implementations also incorporate two-factor authentication by ensuring that the one-time password requires access to something a person has (such as a small keyring fob device with the OTP calculator built into it, or a smartcard or specific cellphone) as well as something a person knows (such as a PIN). The most important advantage that is addressed by OTPs is that, in contrast to static passwords, they are not vulnerable to replay attacks.&nbsp;[†](#w-otp)

Open Graph Protocol
: A microformat that enables developers to integrate their pages into Facebook’s Social Graph, a global mapping and tracking tool. Respective pages gain the functionality of other graph objects including profile links and stream updates for connected users. OGP was created in 2010 by Facebook.&nbsp;[†](#w-facebook-platform) ℹ︎&nbsp;[ogp.me](https://ogp.me/)

Open Source
: Products that include permission to use the source code, design documents, or content of the product. It most commonly refers to the open source model, in which open source software or other products are released under an open source license as part of the Open Source Software Movement. Use of the term originated with software, but has expanded beyond the software sector to cover other open content and forms of open collaboration.&nbsp;[†](#w-open-source) ℹ︎&nbsp;[opensource.org](https://opensource.org/)

Open Web Application Security Project
: An online community that produces freely-available articles, methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies in the field of web application security. OWASP was founded in 2001.&nbsp;[†](#w-owasp) ℹ︎&nbsp;[owasp.org](https://www.owasp.org/)

Opera
: A cross-platform web browser. Opera was first released in 1995. ℹ︎&nbsp;[opera.com](https://www.opera.com/)

Operand
: In mathematics, the object of a mathematical operation, i.e., the object or quantity that is operated on. In “3 + 6”, “3” and “6” are operands, while “+” is an (addition) operator.&nbsp;[†](#w-operand)

Operating System
: System software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer—from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.&nbsp;[†](#w-os)

Operator
: In mathematics, a mapping that acts on elements of a space to produce elements of another space (possibly the same space, sometimes required to be the same space). An operator is also used for denoting the symbol of a mathematical operation, which is related with the meaning of “operator” in computer programming.&nbsp;[†](#w-operator-math)
: In programming, constructs which behave generally like functions, but which differ syntactically or semantically from usual functions. Common simple examples include arithmetic (addition with `+`), comparison (with `>`), and logical operations (such as `AND` or `&&`). More involved examples include assignment (usually `=` or `:=`), field access in a record or object (usually `.`), and the scope resolution operator (often `::`). Languages usually define a set of built-in operators, and in some cases allow users to add new meanings to existing operators or even define completely new operators.&nbsp;[†](#w-operator-computer-science)

Optimization
: The selection of a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives. Optimization problems of sorts arise in all quantitative disciplines from computer science and engineering to operations research and economics, and the development of solution methods has been of interest in mathematics for centuries. In the simplest case, an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function.&nbsp;[†](#w-optimization)

Optional markup
: Markup (like HTML code and particular tags, attributes, and quotes) that is not necessary for respective document to be valid.

Orca
: An extensible screen reader from the GNOME project for individuals who are blind or visually impaired. Using various combinations of speech synthesis and braille, Orca helps provide access to applications and toolkits that support the AT-SPI. The name Orca, which is another term for a killer whale, is a nod to the long-standing tradition of naming screen readers after aquatic creatures.&nbsp;[†](#w-orca) ℹ︎&nbsp;[wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca)

Origin
: A concept defined by the scheme (protocol), host (domain), and port of the URL used to access it. Two objects have the same origin only when the scheme, host, and port all match. Some operations are restricted to same-origin content, and this restriction can be lifted using CORS.&nbsp;[‡](#m-origin)

Orphan
: A paragraph-opening line that appears by itself at the bottom of a page or column, separated from the rest of the text. Mnemonically, an orphan is “alone at the bottom.”&nbsp;[†](#w-widows-orphans)

Orthogonality
: A software design principle meaning that change of one piece of software does not affect other pieces, or that operations do not have side-effects. Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways to build the control and data structures of the language. It is associated with simplicity; the more orthogonal the design, the fewer exceptions. This makes it easier to learn, read and write programs in a programming language. The meaning of an orthogonal feature is independent of context; the key parameters are symmetry and consistency (for example, a pointer is an orthogonal concept).&nbsp;[†](#w-orthogonality)

OS

OSI Model
: A conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols. The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers. The original version of the model had seven layers, namely the physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers. The OSI Model was first in defined in 1978.&nbsp;[†](#w-osi-model)

Outline
: A CSS feature managed with special `outline` properties that allows to draw lines around elements. A CSS outline is different from a border in that it does not take up space, and that it may be non-rectangular.

Over the Air
: Various methods of distributing new software, configuration settings, and even encryption keys to devices like mobile phones, set-top boxes, or secure voice communication equipment (encrypted 2-way radios). One important feature of OTA is that one central location can send an update to all the users and that the update applies immediately to everyone on the channel.&nbsp;[†](#w-ota)
