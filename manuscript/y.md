# Y

Yahoo! User Interface Library
: A discontinued JavaScript library for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such as Ajax, DHTML, and DOM scripting. YUI includes several core CSS resources. Development on YUI began in 2005 and Yahoo! properties such as My Yahoo! and the Yahoo! front page began using YUI in the summer of that year. YUI was released for public use in 2006, and development stopped in 2014.&nbsp;[†](#w-yui) ℹ︎&nbsp;[yuilibrary.com](https://yuilibrary.com/)

YAML Ain’t Markup Language
: A human-readable data-serialization language that is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as XML but has a minimal syntax which intentionally differs from SGML. It uses both Python-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses `[]` for lists and `{}` for maps, making YAML 1.2 a superset of JSON.&nbsp;[†](#w-yaml) ℹ︎&nbsp;[yaml.org](https://yaml.org/)
