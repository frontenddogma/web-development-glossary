Yahoo Query Language
: An SQL-like query language created by Yahoo as part of their Yahoo Developer Network (YDN). YQL is designed to retrieve and manipulate data from APIs through a single web interface, thus allowing mashups that enable developers to create their own applications. YQL was launched in 2008 and retired in 2019 with the YQL API service.&nbsp;[†](#w-yql)

Development on YUI began in 2005; Yahoo properties such as My Yahoo and the Yahoo front page began using YUI in the summer of that year. YUI was released for public use in 2006, and development stopped in 2014.&nbsp;[†](#w-yui) ℹ︎&nbsp;[yuilibrary.com](https://yuilibrary.com/)

YAML Ain’t Markup Language
: A human-readable data-serialization language that is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as XML but has a minimal syntax which intentionally differs from SGML. It uses both Python-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses `[]` for lists and `{}` for maps, making YAML 1.2 a superset of JSON.&nbsp;[†](#w-yaml) ℹ︎&nbsp;[yaml.org](https://yaml.org/)

Yandex Browser
: A web browser developed by the web search company Yandex that is based on the Chromium project and uses the Blink web browser engine. The browser checks web page security with the Yandex security system, and downloaded files with Kaspersky Anti-Virus. Yandex Browser was first released in 2012.&nbsp;[†](#w-yandex-browser) ℹ︎&nbsp;[yaml.org](https://yaml.org/) ℹ︎&nbsp;[browser.yandex.com](https://browser.yandex.com/)

Year 2000 problem
: Anticipated and manifested problems related to the formatting and storage of calendar data for dates beginning in the year 2000, due to programs representing four-digit years with only the final two digits, thereby making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900. The assumption of a twentieth-century date in such programs could cause various errors, such as the incorrect display of dates and the inaccurate ordering of automated dated records or real-time events. Companies and organisations in some countries, but not all, checked, fixed, and upgraded their computer systems to address the anticipated problem. Few computer failures were reported when the clocks rolled over into 2000.&nbsp;[†](#w-y2k)

Yet Another Multicolumn Layout
: A modular HTML/CSS framework. YAML was first released in 2005. ℹ︎&nbsp;[yaml.de](http://www.yaml.de/)

You Aren’t Gonna Need It
: A principle of Extreme Programming (XP) that states that a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. Quoting XP co-founder Ron Jeffries, “Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.” Other forms of the phrase include “You aren’t going to need it” and “You ain’t gonna need it.”&nbsp;[†](#w-yagni)

Your Money or Your Life
: A category from Google’s _Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines_ that covers websites and apps that may impact “a person’s future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety” and for which result quality is particularly important.

YSlow
: A possibly retired browser extension and bookmarklet to analyze and improve website performance. ℹ︎&nbsp;[yslow.org](http://yslow.org/)
