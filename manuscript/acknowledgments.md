_The Web Development Glossary_ would not have been possible without help. I thank Gabriele Kretzschmar for review of the manuscript, and Ganesh Subramanian and Yaroslav Kiyenko for advice on book details. I am also grateful to Wikipedia, the Mozilla Developer Network, and all their contributors for their own work mapping the web development landscape, and allowing others to build on that work. Thank&nbsp;you.

I also thank Lucas Frank Weatherhog, who contributed suggestions to the&nbsp;glossary.
