_The Web Development Glossary_ would not have been possible without help. I thank Gabriele Kretzschmar for review of the manuscript, and Ganesh Subramanian and Yaroslav Kiyenko for advice on book details. I am also grateful to Wikipedia, the MDN Web Docs, and all their contributors for their own work mapping the web development landscape, and allowing others to build on that work. Thank you.

I also thank Lucas Frank Weatherhog, Dan Shappir, [Shaun O’Connell](https://tactile.co.za/), [Moritz Gießmann](https://moritzgiessmann.de/), [J. Albert Bowden II](https://bowdenweb.com/), [Tommy Williams](https://twwilliams.com/), and Kirsty MacRae who contributed with corrections and suggestions to the glossary, as well as [Red Onion](https://redonion.se/) for their friendly support.
