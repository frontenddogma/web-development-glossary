Eclipse
: An integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming. Eclipse contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. It is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications, but it may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages.&nbsp;[†](#w-eclipse) ℹ︎&nbsp;[eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/)

ECMA
: → European Computer Manufacturers Association

Ecma International
: A standards organization for information and communication systems. Ecma International acquired its current name in 1994, when the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) changed its name to reflect the organization’s global reach and activities. The organization was founded in 1961 to standardize computer systems in Europe. Membership is open to large and small companies worldwide that produce, market or develop computer or communication systems, and have interest and experience in the areas addressed by the group’s technical bodies. Ecma is located in Geneva.&nbsp;[†](#w-ecma-international) ℹ︎&nbsp;[ecma-international.org](https://www.ecma-international.org/)

ECMAScript
: ECMAScript (or ES) is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262. It was created to standardize JavaScript to help foster multiple independent implementations. JavaScript has remained the best-known implementation of ECMAScript since the standard was first published, with other well-known implementations including JScript and ActionScript. ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.&nbsp;[†](#w-ecmascript)

Edge
: A cross-platform web browser. Edge was released by Microsoft, first for Windows 10 and Xbox One in 2015, then for Android and iOS in 2017, and for macOS in 2019.&nbsp;[†](#w-edge) ℹ︎&nbsp;[microsoft.com/microsoft-edge](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge)

Editor
: As source code editor, a text editor program designed specifically for editing source code of computer programs. It may be a standalone application or it may be built into an integrated development environment (IDE) or web browser. Source code editors are a fundamental programming tool, as the fundamental job of programmers is to write and edit source code.&nbsp;[†](#w-editor)

EditorConfig
: A file format for defining coding styles. ℹ︎&nbsp;[editorconfig.org](https://editorconfig.org/)

EFF
: → Electronic Frontier Foundation

Effective Connection Type
: The measured network performance, returning a cellular connection type, like 3G, even if the actual connection is tethered broadband or WiFi, based on the time between the browser requesting a page and effective type of the connection. ECT’s values of `slow-2g`, `2g`, `3g`, and `4g` are determined using observed round-trip times and downlink values.&nbsp;[‡](#m-ect) ℹ︎&nbsp;[wicg.github.io/netinfo](https://wicg.github.io/netinfo/)

Effectiveness
: The capability of producing a desired result or the ability to produce desired output. When something is deemed effective, it means it has an intended or expected outcome, or produces a deep, vivid impression. Not to be confused with efficiency.&nbsp;[†](#w-effectiveness)

Efficiency
: The (often measurable) ability to avoid wasting materials, energy, efforts, money, and time in doing something or in producing a desired result. In a more general sense, it is the ability to do things well, successfully, and without waste. In more mathematical or scientific terms, it is a measure of the extent to which input is well used for an intended task or function (output). It often specifically comprises the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort. Not to be confused with effectiveness.&nbsp;[†](#w-efficiency)

Electronic Frontier Foundation
: An international non-profit digital rights group based in San Francisco, California. The foundation was formed in 1990 by John Gilmore, John Perry Barlow, and Mitch Kapor to promote Internet civil liberties.&nbsp;[†](#w-eff) ℹ︎&nbsp;[eff.org](https://www.eff.org/)

Element
: In HTML, a part of an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document that can be represented through a tag. Element nodes can have HTML attributes specified. Nodes can also have content, including other nodes and text. Most HTML elements represent semantics, that is, have a particular meaning.&nbsp;[†](#w-element)

Em
: A typographic unit equal to the currently specified point size. For example, one em in a 16-point typeface is 16 points. Therefore, this unit is the same for all typefaces at a given point size. In CSS, the `em` unit is the height of the font in nominal points or inches.&nbsp;[†](#w-em)

Emacs
: A family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor.” Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on its direct descendant, GNU Emacs, continues actively as of 2019.&nbsp;[†](#w-emacs) ℹ︎&nbsp;[gnu.org/software/emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

Email
: A method of exchanging messages (“mail”) between people using electronic devices. Invented by Ray Tomlinson, email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email. Email operates across computer networks, which today is primarily the Internet. Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time, in common with instant messaging. Today’s email systems are based on a store-and-forward model.&nbsp;[†](#w-email)

Email address
: An identifier for an email box to which email messages are delivered. A wide variety of formats were used in early email systems, but only a single format is used today, following the specifications developed for Internet mail systems since the 1980s. An email address such as jane.doe@example.com is made up of a local-part, an @ symbol, then a case-insensitive domain.&nbsp;[†](#w-email-address)

Embedded content
: Content that imports another resource into the document, or content from another vocabulary that is inserted into the document. Embedded content is marked up through the `audio`, `canvas`, `embed`, `iframe`, `img`, MathML `math`, `object`, `picture`, SVG `svg`, and `video` elements.&nbsp;§

EME
: → Encrypted Media Extensions

Empiricism
: A model in which only the past is accepted as certain and in which decisions are based on observation, experience, and experimentation. Empiricism is based on the concepts of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

Empty string
: The unique string of length zero.&nbsp;[†](#w-empty-string)

Encapsulation
: The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object’s components. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties’ direct access to them. Publicly accessible methods are generally provided in the class (so-called “getters” and “setters”) to access the values, and other client classes call these methods to retrieve and modify the values within the object.&nbsp;[†](#w-encapsulation)

Encrypted Media Extensions
: A W3C specification for providing a communication channel between web browsers and digital rights management (DRM) agent software. EME allows the use of HTML5 video to play back DRM-wrapped content such as streaming video services without the use of heavy third-party media plugins like Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight. The use of a third-party key management system may be required, depending on whether the publisher chooses to scramble the keys. EME is based on the Media Source Extensions specification. ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/encrypted-media](https://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media/)

Encryption
: The process of converting ordinary information (called plaintext) into unintelligible form (called ciphertext).&nbsp;[†](#w-cryptography)

End of line
: → Newline

End tag
: The closing tag of an HTML or another markup language’s element, like `</p>`, a paragraph’s end tag.

End of file
: A condition in a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source. The data source is usually called a file or stream. The actual value of EOF is implementation-dependent (but is commonly `-1`, such as in glibc) and is distinct from all valid character codes. Block-reading functions return the number of bytes read, and if this is fewer than asked for, then the end of file was reached or an error occurred (checking of errno or dedicated function, such as ferror is often required to determine which).&nbsp;[†](#w-eof)

End-to-end testing
: A software test methodology focused on testing an entire application from start to end based on conditions that are as realistic as possible, explicitly including dependencies on other software and infrastructure.

Entity
: A primitive data type, which associates a string with either a unique alias (such as a user-specified name) or an SGML reserved word (such as `#DEFAULT`). Entities are foundational to the organizational structure and definition of SGML documents. The SGML specification defines numerous entity types, which are distinguished by keyword qualifiers and context. An entity string value may variously consist of plain text, SGML tags, or references to previously defined entities.&nbsp;[†](#w-entity)

Ethics
: A branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime. Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are 1) meta-ethics, concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their truth values (if any) can be determined; 2) normative ethics, concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action; 3) applied ethics, concerning what a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action.&nbsp;[†](#w-ethics)

Etiquette
: The set of conventional rules of personal behaviour in polite society, usually in the form of an ethical code that delineates the expected and accepted social behaviors that accord with the conventions and norms observed by a society, a social class, or a social group. In modern English usage, the French word “étiquette” (“ticket”) dates from the year 1750.&nbsp;[†](#w-etiquette)

Event
: An action or occurrence recognized by software, often originating asynchronously from the external environment, that may be handled by the software. Computer events can be generated or triggered by the system, by the user or in other ways. Typically, events are handled synchronously with the program flow, that is, the software may have one or more dedicated places where events are handled, frequently an event loop. A source of events includes the user, who may interact with the software by way of, for example, keystrokes on the keyboard. Another source is a hardware device such as a timer. Software can also trigger its own set of events into the event loop, e.g. to communicate the completion of a task. Software that changes its behavior in response to events is said to be event-driven, often with the goal of being interactive.&nbsp;[†](#w-event)

Event handler
: A mechanism that allows to be notified of DOM events. Two common approaches are `addEventListener()` and specific `onevent` handlers.&nbsp;[‡](#m-event-handler)

Evidence-Based Management
: An empirical framework that documents means by which value can be delivered to customers, measures the value delivered, and uses those measures to guide improvements. ℹ︎&nbsp;[scrum.org/resources/evidence-based-management](https://www.scrum.org/resources/evidence-based-management)

Exception
: A condition that interrupts normal code execution. In JavaScript syntax errors are a very common source of exceptions.&nbsp;[‡](#m-exception)

Exception handling
: The process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, of exceptions—anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing—often disrupting the normal flow of program execution. Exception handling is provided by specialized programming language constructs, computer hardware mechanisms like interrupts, or operating system IPC facilities like signals.&nbsp;[†](#w-exception-handling)

Exit code
: → Exit status

Exit status
: A small number passed from a child process (or callee) to a parent process (or caller) when it has finished executing a specific procedure or delegated task.&nbsp;[†](#w-exit-status)

Express
: A web application framework for Node.js. Express is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. Express was first released in 2010.&nbsp;[†](#w-express) ℹ︎&nbsp;[expressjs.com](https://expressjs.com/)

Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code
: An 8-bit character encoding used mainly on IBM mainframe and IBM midrange computer operating systems. It descended from the code used with punched cards and the corresponding six-bit binary-coded decimal code used with most of IBM’s computer peripherals of the late 1950s and early 1960s.&nbsp;[†](#w-ebcdic)

Extensible HyperText Markup Language
: A part of the family of XML markup languages. It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the language in which Web pages are formulated. While HTML, prior to HTML5, was defined as an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a flexible markup language framework, XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. XHTML documents are well-formed and may therefore be parsed using standard XML parsers, unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser.&nbsp;[†](#w-xhtml) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/xhtml11](https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/)

Extensible Markup Language
: A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The W3C’s XML 1.0 Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications define XML. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services.&nbsp;[†](#w-xml) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/XML](https://www.w3.org/XML/)

Extensible Stylesheet Language
: A family of languages used to transform and render XML documents. Historically, the W3C’s XSL Working Group produced a draft specification under the name “XSL,” which eventually split into three parts: 1) XSL Transformation (XSLT), an XML language for transforming XML documents; 2) XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO), an XML language for specifying the visual formatting of an XML document; and 3) XML Path Language (XPath), a non-XML language used by XSLT, and also available for use in non-XSLT contexts, for addressing the parts of an XML document. The term “XSL” is now used with a number of different meanings.&nbsp;[†](#w-xsl) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/Style/XSL](https://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/)

Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
: A declarative language used to convert XML documents into other XML documents, HTML, PDF, plain text, and so on. XSLT has its own processor that accepts XML input, or any format convertible to an XQuery and XPath Data Model. The XSLT processor produces a new document based on the XML document and an XSLT stylesheet, making no changes to the original files in the process.&nbsp;[‡](#m-xslt) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/xslt](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt/)

External
: Not developed within one’s organization.

Extreme Programming
: A software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, XP advocates frequent “releases” in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted. Other elements of Extreme Programming include: programming in pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, avoiding programming of features until they are actually needed, a flat management structure, code simplicity and clarity, expecting changes in the customer’s requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers.&nbsp;[†](#w-xp)
