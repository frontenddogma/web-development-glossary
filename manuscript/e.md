ECMAScript
: ECMAScript (or ES) is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262. It was created to standardize JavaScript to help foster multiple independent implementations. JavaScript has remained the best-known implementation of ECMAScript since the standard was first published, with other well-known implementations including JScript and ActionScript. ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.&nbsp;[†](#w-ecmascript)

Edge
: A cross-platform web browser. Edge was released by Microsoft, first for Windows 10 and Xbox One in 2015, then for Android and iOS in 2017, and for macOS in 2019.&nbsp;[†](#w-edge) 🌍&nbsp;[microsoft.com/microsoft-edge](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge)

Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
: A declarative language used to convert XML documents into other XML documents, HTML, PDF, plain text, and so on. XSLT has its own processor that accepts XML input, or any format convertible to an XQuery and XPath Data Model. The XSLT processor produces a new document based on the XML document and an XSLT stylesheet, making no changes to the original files in the process.&nbsp;[‡](#m-xslt) 🌍&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/xslt](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt/)
