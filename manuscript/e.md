ECMAScript
: ECMAScript (or ES) is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262. It was created to standardize JavaScript to help foster multiple independent implementations. JavaScript has remained the best-known implementation of ECMAScript since the standard was first published, with other well-known implementations including JScript and ActionScript. ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.&nbsp;[†](#w-ecmascript)

Edge
: A cross-platform web browser. Edge was released by Microsoft, first for Windows 10 and Xbox One in 2015, then for Android and iOS in 2017, and for macOS in 2019.&nbsp;[†](#w-edge) 🌍&nbsp;[microsoft.com/microsoft-edge](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge)

Editor
: As source code editor, a text editor program designed specifically for editing source code of computer programs. It may be a standalone application or it may be built into an integrated development environment (IDE) or web browser. Source-code editors are a fundamental programming tool, as the fundamental job of programmers is to write and edit source code.&nbsp;[†](#w-editor)

Effectiveness
: The capability of producing a desired result or the ability to produce desired output. When something is deemed effective, it means it has an intended or expected outcome, or produces a deep, vivid impression. Not to be confused with efficiency.&nbsp;[†](#w-effectiveness)

Efficiency
: The (often measurable) ability to avoid wasting materials, energy, efforts, money, and time in doing something or in producing a desired result. In a more general sense, it is the ability to do things well, successfully, and without waste. In more mathematical or scientific terms, it is a measure of the extent to which input is well used for an intended task or function (output). It often specifically comprises the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort. Not to be confused with effectiveness.&nbsp;[†](#w-efficiency)

Element
: In HTML, a part of an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document that can be represented through a tag. Element nodes can have HTML attributes specified. Nodes can also have content, including other nodes and text. Most HTML elements represent semantics, or meaning.&nbsp;[†](#w-element)

Em
: A typographic unit equal to the currently specified point size. For example, one em in a 16-point typeface is 16 points. Therefore, this unit is the same for all typefaces at a given point size. In CSS, the `em` unit is the height of the font in nominal points or inches.&nbsp;[†](#w-em)

Emacs
: A family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor.” Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on its direct descendant, GNU Emacs, continues actively as of 2019.&nbsp;[†](#w-emacs) 🌍&nbsp;[gnu.org/software/emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

Email
: A method of exchanging messages (“mail”) between people using electronic devices. Invented by Ray Tomlinson, email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email. Email operates across computer networks, which today is primarily the Internet. Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time, in common with instant messaging. Today’s email systems are based on a store-and-forward model.&nbsp;[†](#w-email)

Empiricism
: A model in which only the past is accepted as certain and in which decisions are based on observation, experience, and experimentation. Empiricism is based on the concepts of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
: A declarative language used to convert XML documents into other XML documents, HTML, PDF, plain text, and so on. XSLT has its own processor that accepts XML input, or any format convertible to an XQuery and XPath Data Model.
