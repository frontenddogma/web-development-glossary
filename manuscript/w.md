Waterfall
: A breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialisation of tasks. The approach is typical for certain areas of engineering design. In software development, it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction (“downwards” like a waterfall).&nbsp;[†](#w-waterfall)

WCAG

WCAG Samurai
: A group of developers independent of the W3C, led by Joe Clark, that from 2006 to 2008 published suggestions, corrections, and extensions to WCAG&nbsp;1.0.&nbsp;[†](#w-wcag)

Web 2.0
: Websites that emphasize user-generated content, ease of use, participatory culture and interoperability (i.e., compatible with other products, systems, and devices) for end users. The term was invented by Darcy DiNucci in 1999 and later popularized by Tim O’Reilly and Dale Dougherty at the O’Reilly Media Web 2.0 Conference in late 2004. The Web 2.0 framework specifies only the design and use of websites and does not place any technical demands or specifications on designers. The transition was gradual and, therefore, no precise date for when this change happened has been given.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-20)

Web Accessibility Initiative
: An effort to improve the accessibility of the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) for people with disabilities. People with disabilities may encounter difficulties when using computers generally, but also on the Web. Since people with disabilities often require non-standard devices and browsers, making websites more accessible also benefits a wide range of user agents and devices, including mobile devices, which have limited resources. The W3C launched the Web Accessibility Initiative in 1997 with endorsement by The White House and W3C members. It has several working groups and interest groups that work on guidelines, technical reports, educational materials, and other documents that relate to the several different components of web accessibility.&nbsp;[†](#w-wai) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)

Web analytics
: The measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of web data for purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage. However, Web analytics is not just a process for measuring web traffic but can be used as a tool for business and market research, and to assess and improve the effectiveness of a website. Web analytics applications can also help companies measure the results of traditional print or broadcast advertising campaigns.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-analytics)

Web component
: A set of features that provide a standard component model for the Web allowing for encapsulation and interoperability of individual HTML elements. The primary technologies used to create web components include custom elements (APIs to define new HTML elements), Shadow DOM (encapsulated DOM and styling, with composition), and HTML templates (HTML fragment that are not rendered, but stored until instantiated via JavaScript).&nbsp;[†](#w-web-component) ℹ︎&nbsp;[webcomponents.org](https://www.webcomponents.org/)

Web content
: The textual, visual, or aural content that is encountered as part of the user experience on websites. It may include—among other things—text, images, sounds, videos, and animations.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-content)

Web framework
: Software that supports the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications. Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. For example, many web frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, and they often promote code reuse. Although they often target development of dynamic web sites, they are also applicable to static websites.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-framework)

Web indexing
: The indexing of contents of a website or of the Internet as a whole. Individual websites or intranets may use a back-of-the-book index, while search engines usually use keywords and metadata to provide a more useful vocabulary for Internet or onsite searching. With the increase in the number of periodicals that have articles online, web indexing is also becoming important for periodical websites.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-indexing)

Widow
: A paragraph-ending word that falls at the beginning of the following page or column, separated from the rest of the text. Mnemonically, a widow is “alone at the top.”&nbsp;[†](#w-widows-orphans)

Window-Eyes

Windows
: A group of several proprietary graphical operating system families, all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry. Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE). Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone. Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows in 1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).&nbsp;[†](#w-windows) ℹ︎&nbsp;[microsoft.com/windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows)

Windows Aero
: A design language introduced in the Windows Vista operating system. “Aero” is a backronym for “Authentic, Energetic, Reflective, and Open.” Windows Aero was in force during the development of Windows Vista and Windows 7. In 2012, with the development of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, Microsoft moved on to a design language codenamed “Metro.”&nbsp;[†](#w-windows-aero)

: The main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and currently led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations which maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web. The consortium also engages in education and outreach, develops software, and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.&nbsp;[†](#w-w3c) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org](https://www.w3.org/)

Write Once, Run Anywhere
: A slogan created by Sun Microsystems to illustrate the cross-platform benefits of the Java language. Ideally, this meant that a Java program could be developed on any device, compiled into a standard bytecode, and be expected to run on any device equipped with a Java virtual machine (JVM). The installation of a JVM or Java interpreter on chips, devices, or software packages became an industry standard practice.&nbsp;[†](#w-wora)
