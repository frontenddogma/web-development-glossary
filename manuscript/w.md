Waterfall
: A breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialisation of tasks. The approach is typical for certain areas of engineering design. In software development, it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction (“downwards” like a waterfall).&nbsp;[†](#w-waterfall)

WCAG Samurai
: A group of developers independent of the W3C, led by Joe Clark, that from 2006 to 2008 published suggestions, corrections, and extensions to WCAG&nbsp;1.0.&nbsp;[†](#w-wcag)

Web 2.0
: Websites that emphasize user-generated content, ease of use, participatory culture and interoperability (i.e., compatible with other products, systems, and devices) for end users. The term was invented by Darcy DiNucci in 1999 and later popularized by Tim O’Reilly and Dale Dougherty at the O’Reilly Media Web 2.0 Conference in late 2004. The Web 2.0 framework specifies only the design and use of websites and does not place any technical demands or specifications on designers. The transition was gradual and, therefore, no precise date for when this change happened has been given.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-20)

Web Accessibility Initiative
: An effort to improve the accessibility of the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) for people with disabilities. People with disabilities may encounter difficulties when using computers generally, but also on the Web. Since people with disabilities often require non-standard devices and browsers, making websites more accessible also benefits a wide range of user agents and devices, including mobile devices, which have limited resources. The W3C launched the Web Accessibility Initiative in 1997 with endorsement by The White House and W3C members. It has several working groups and interest groups that work on guidelines, technical reports, educational materials, and other documents that relate to the several different components of web accessibility.&nbsp;[†](#w-wai) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)

Web Bundles
: A draft standard to to bundle and store HTTP responses. Web Bundles are a part of Google’s Web Packaging effort. ℹ︎&nbsp;[github.com/WICG/webpackage](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage)

Web component
: A set of features that provide a standard component model for the Web allowing for encapsulation and interoperability of individual HTML elements. The primary technologies used to create web components include custom elements (APIs to define new HTML elements), Shadow DOM (encapsulated DOM and styling, with composition), and HTML templates (HTML fragment that are not rendered, but stored until instantiated via JavaScript).&nbsp;[†](#w-web-component) ℹ︎&nbsp;[webcomponents.org](https://www.webcomponents.org/)

Web content
: The textual, visual, or aural content that is encountered as part of the user experience on websites. It may include—among other things—text, images, sounds, videos, and animations.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-content)

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
: A part of a series of web accessibility guidelines published by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). WCAG are a set of recommendations for making Web content more accessible, primarily for people with disabilities, but also for user agents, including highly limited devices, such as mobile phones. WCAG 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation in 1999. ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/WCAG21](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)

Web design
: Skills and disciplines related to the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term “web design” is normally used to describe the design process relating to the frontend (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-design)

Web development
: The work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based Internet applications (web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, “web development” usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building websites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-development)

Web feed
: → Feed

Web font
: A CSS feature that allows to specify font files to be downloaded along with a website as it is accessed, meaning that any browser that supports web fonts can have exactly the fonts specified available to it. Web fonts are based on `@font-face` rules, which specify the font file(s) to download. Several services, like Google Fonts, make it easy to choose and implement web fonts.&nbsp;[‡](#m-web-font)

Web forms
: A revision of HTML forms that influenced and got integrated in HTML&nbsp;5. A first draft for Web Forms was released in 2003. ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/web-forms-2](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-forms-2/)

Web framework
: Software that supports the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications. Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. For example, many web frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, and they often promote code reuse. Although they often target development of dynamic websites, they are also applicable to static websites.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-framework)

Web Graphics Library
: A JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plugins. WebGL is fully integrated with other web standards, allowing GPU-accelerated usage of physics and image processing and effects as part of the web page canvas. WebGL elements can be mixed with other HTML elements and composited with other parts of the page or page background.&nbsp;[†](#w-webgl) ℹ︎&nbsp;[khronos.org/webgl](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/)

Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
: A community of people interested in evolving HTML and related technologies. The WHATWG was founded by individuals from Apple, the Mozilla Foundation, and Opera, leading Web browser vendors, in 2004. Google subsequently joined the WHATWG with the move of the then-editor of the WHATWG specifications, Ian Hickson, to Google (originally with Opera). The central organizational membership and control of WHATWG today—its “Steering Group”—consists of Apple, Mozilla, Google, and Microsoft. WHATWG has a small, invitation-only oversight committee called “Members,” which has the power to impeach the editor of the specifications.&nbsp;[†](#w-whatwg) ℹ︎&nbsp;[whatwg.org](https://whatwg.org/)

Web IDL
: An interface description language (IDL) format for describing application programming interfaces (APIs) that are intended to be implemented in web browsers. Web IDL is an IDL variant with a number of features that allow one to more easily describe the behavior of common script objects in a web context, and a mapping of how interfaces described with Web IDL correspond to language constructs within an ECMAScript execution environment.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-idl)

Web indexing
: The indexing of contents of a website or of the Internet as a whole. Individual websites or intranets may use a back-of-the-book index, while search engines usually use keywords and metadata to provide a more useful vocabulary for Internet or onsite searching. With the increase in the number of periodicals that have articles online, web indexing is also becoming important for periodical websites.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-indexing)

Web Packaging
: A set of draft standards for packaging websites, developed by Google. Web Packaging focuses on bundling website resources with provisions for authentication and offline sharing. ℹ︎&nbsp;[github.com/WICG/webpackage](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage)

Web page
: A document that acts as a web resource on the World Wide Web. In order to display a web page, a web browser is needed to retrieve web pages from the Internet. When accessed by a web browser it may be displayed as a web page on a monitor or mobile device. Typical web pages are hypertext documents which contain hyperlinks for browsing to other web pages. The term “web page” usually refers to what is visible, but may also refer to the contents of the source code itself, which is usually a file containing hypertext written in HTML or a comparable markup language.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-page)

Web performance
: → Performance

Web Performance Optimization
: The field of knowledge about increasing web performance, focusing on how to make websites and app faster, or get them to appear faster (perceived performance).&nbsp;[†](#w-performance)

Web resource
: Any identifiable thing or entity, whether digital, physical, or abstract. Resources are identified using Uniform Resource Identifiers. In the Semantic Web, web resources and their semantic properties are described using the Resource Description Framework. The concept of a web resource has evolved during the Web’s history, from the early notion of static addressable documents or files, to a more generic and abstract definition, now encompassing everything that can be identified, named, addressed or handled, in any way whatsoever, in the Web at large, or in any networked information system.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-resource)

Web service
: A server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents (HTML, JSON, XML, images), and creating web applications services, which serve in solving specific domain problems over the Web.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-service)
: A service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the World Wide Web.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-service)

Web site
: → Website

Web standard
: A technical standard related to the Web, or the formal, non-proprietary standards and other technical specifications that define and describe aspects of the World Wide Web. In recent years, the term has been more frequently associated with the trend of endorsing a set of standardized best practices for building websites, and a philosophy of web design and development that includes those methods.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-standard)

Web standards movement
: A grassroots coalition fighting for improved web standards support in browsers. The web standards movement supports concepts of standards-based web design, including the separation of document structure from a web page or application’s appearance and behavior; an emphasis on semantically structured content that validates (that is, contains no errors of structural composition) when tested against validation software maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium; and progressive enhancement, a layered approach to web page and application creation that enables all people and devices to access the content and functionality of a page, regardless of personal physical ability (accessibility), connection speed, and browser capability.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-standard)

Web Standards Project
: A dissolved group of professional web developers dedicated to disseminating and encouraging the use of the web standards recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium, along with other groups and standards bodies. Founded in 1998, The Web Standards Project campaigned for standards that reduce the cost and complexity of development while increasing the accessibility and long-term viability of any document published on the Web. WaSP worked with browser companies, authoring tool makers, and peers to encourage them to use these standards, since they “are carefully designed to deliver the greatest benefits to the greatest number of web users.” The group disbanded in 2013.&nbsp;[†](#w-wasp) ℹ︎&nbsp;[webstandards.org](https://www.webstandards.org/)

Web storage
: Methods and protocols for storing client-side data. Web storage supports persistent data storage, similar to cookies but with a greatly enhanced capacity and no information stored in the HTTP request header. There are two main web storage types: local storage and session storage, behaving similarly to persistent cookies and session cookies respectively. Web storage is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and WHATWG.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-storage)

Web typography
: The use of fonts on the World Wide Web. When HTML was first created, font faces and styles were controlled exclusively by the settings of each web browser. There was no mechanism for individual web pages to control font display until Netscape introduced the `font` element in 1995, which was then standardized in the HTML&nbsp;3.2 specification. However, the font specified had to be installed on the user’s computer or a fallback font, such as a browser’s default sans-serif or monospace font, would be used. The CSS&nbsp;2 specification was released in 1998 and attempted to improve the font selection process by adding font matching, synthesis and download. These techniques did not gain much use, and were removed in the CSS&nbsp;2.1 specification. However, Internet Explorer added support for the font downloading feature in version 4.0, released in 1997. Font downloading was later included in the CSS&nbsp;3 fonts module, and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in Web typography, as well as the usage of font downloading.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-typography)

Web worker
: A JavaScript script executed from an HTML page that runs in the background, independently of user-interface scripts that may also have been executed from the same HTML page. The W3C and WHATWG envision web workers as long-running scripts that are not interrupted by user-interface scripts (scripts that respond to clicks or other user interactions). Keeping such workers from being interrupted by user activities should allow web pages to remain responsive at the same time as they are running long tasks in the background.&nbsp;[†](#w-web-worker) ℹ︎&nbsp;[is.gd/A546Cx](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html)

WebAssembly
: A standard that defines a portable binary code format for executable programs, and a corresponding textual assembly language, as well as interfaces for facilitating interactions between such programs and their host environment. The main goal of WebAssembly is to enable high performance applications on web pages, but the format is designed to be executed and integrated in other environments as well. WebAssembly became a World Wide Web Consortium recommendation in 2019 and, alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is the fourth language to run natively in browsers.&nbsp;[†](#w-wasm) ℹ︎&nbsp;[webassembly.org](https://webassembly.org/)

WebAuthn
: A core component of the FIDO2 Project under the guidance of the FIDO Alliance. The goal of the project is to standardize an interface for authenticating users to web-based applications and services using public-key cryptography. Support for WebAuthn can be implemented in a variety of ways. The underlying cryptographic operations are performed by an authenticator, which is an abstract functional model that is mostly agnostic with respect to how the key material is managed. This makes it possible to implement support for WebAuthn purely in software, making use of a processor’s trusted execution environment or a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Sensitive cryptographic operations can also be offloaded to a roaming hardware authenticator that can in turn be accessed via USB, Bluetooth Low Energy, or near-field communications (NFC). WebAuthn Level 1 was published as a W3C Recommendation in 2019.&nbsp;[†](#w-webauthn) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/webauthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/)

WebGL

WebKit
: A browser engine developed by Apple and primarily used in its Safari web browser, as well as all the iOS web browsers. WebKit’s C++ application programming interface (API) provides a set of classes to display Web content in windows, and implements browser features such as following links when clicked by the user, managing a back-forward list, and managing a history of pages recently visited. WebKit’s HTML and JavaScript engine started as a fork of the KHTML and KJS libraries from KDE, and has since been further developed by KDE contributors, Apple, Google, Nokia, Bitstream, BlackBerry, Igalia, and others. WebKit was first released in 1998.&nbsp;[†](#w-webkit) ℹ︎&nbsp;[webkit.org](https://webkit.org/)

webpack
: A module bundler primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform frontend assets like HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. It takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. webpack was first released in 2012.&nbsp;[†](#w-webpack) ℹ︎&nbsp;[webpack.js.org](https://webpack.js.org/)

WebPageTest
: A web-based website performance testing tool. WebPageTest launched publicly in 2008. ℹ︎&nbsp;[webpagetest.org](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

Website
: A collection of related network web resources, such as web pages, multimedia content, which are typically identified with a common domain name, and published on at least one web server. Websites can be accessed via a public Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet, or a private local area network (LAN), by a uniform resource locator (URL) that identifies the site. Websites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a personal website, a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment and social networking to providing news and education. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such as a company’s website for its employees, are typically part of an intranet.&nbsp;[†](#w-website)

WebSocket
: A computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC&nbsp;6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C. WebSocket is distinct from HTTP, although both protocols are located at layer 7 in the OSI model and depend on TCP at layer 4. The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server.&nbsp;[†](#w-websocket)

WebStorm
: A commercial, cross-platform IDE for JavaScript. WebStorm was first released in 2010. ℹ︎&nbsp;[jetbrains.com/webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

WET
: The opposite of DRY.

What You See Is All You Get
: An idea from _The Pragmatic Programmer_, a disadvantage with WYSIWYG tools.

What You See Is What You Get
: A system where editing software allows content to be edited in a form that resembles its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation. WYSIWYG implies a user interface that allows the user to view something very similar to the end result—while the document is being created. In general, WYSIWYG means the ability to directly manipulate the layout of a document without having to type or remember names of layout commands. The actual meaning depends on the user’s perspective.&nbsp;[†](#w-wysiwyg)

WHATWG
: → Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group

White-box testing
: A method of software testing that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing). In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the expected outputs. White-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration, and system levels of the software testing process.&nbsp;[†](#w-white-box-testing)

Whitelist
: The practice of explicitly allowing identified entities access to a particular privilege, service, mobility, access, or recognition. The opposite of a whitelist is a blacklist.&nbsp;[†](#w-whitelist)

Whitespace
: Any character or series of characters that represent horizontal or vertical space in typography. When rendered, a whitespace character does not correspond to a visible mark, but typically does occupy an area on a page. For example, the common whitespace symbol `U+0020 SPACE` (also ASCII 32) represents a blank space punctuation character in text, used as a word divider in Western scripts.&nbsp;[†](#w-whitespace)

WHOIS
: A query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block or an autonomous system, but is also used for a wider range of other information. The protocol stores and delivers database content in a human-readable format. The current iteration of the WHOIS protocol was drafted by the Internet Society, and is documented in RFC&nbsp;3912. The first WHOIS directory was created in the 1970s.&nbsp;[†](#w-whois)

Widow
: A paragraph-ending word that falls at the beginning of the following page or column, separated from the rest of the text. Mnemonically, a widow is “alone at the top.”&nbsp;[†](#w-widows-orphans)

Window-Eyes
: A screen reader for the Microsoft Windows operating system, developed by GW Micro. Window-Eyes was first released in 1995.&nbsp;[†](#w-window-eyes)

Windows
: A group of several proprietary graphical operating system families, all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry. Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE). Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone. Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows in 1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).&nbsp;[†](#w-windows) ℹ︎&nbsp;[microsoft.com/windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows)

Windows Aero
: A design language introduced in the Windows Vista operating system. “Aero” is a backronym for “Authentic, Energetic, Reflective, and Open.” Windows Aero was in force during the development of Windows Vista and Windows 7. In 2012, with the development of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, Microsoft moved on to a design language codenamed “Metro.”&nbsp;[†](#w-windows-aero)

Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python
: The equivalent of the LAMP or MAMP solution stack but with the Windows operating system.

WIP
: → Work in Progress

Wireframe
: A visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. Wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. The purpose is usually being informed by a business objective and a creative idea. The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the website’s content, including interface elements and navigational systems, and how they work together. The wireframe usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus lies in functionality, behavior, and priority of content. In other words, it focuses on what a screen does, not what it looks like.&nbsp;[†](#w-wireframe)

Wireless Application Protocol
: A technical standard for accessing information over a mobile wireless network. A WAP browser is a web browser for mobile devices such as mobile phones that uses the protocol. Introduced in 1999, WAP achieved some popularity in the early 2000s, but by the 2010s it had been largely superseded by more modern standards. Most modern handset Internet browsers now fully support HTML, so they do not need to use WAP markup for web page compatibility, and therefore, most are no longer able to render and display pages written in WML, WAP’s markup language.&nbsp;[†](#w-wap) ℹ︎&nbsp;[is.gd/ylO55b](https://www.wapforum.org/what/technical.htm)

Wireless Markup Language
: A now-obsolete XML-based markup language intended for devices that implement the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) specification, such as mobile phones. WML provides navigational support, data input, hyperlinks, text and image presentation, and forms, much like HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It preceded the use of other markup languages now used with WAP, such as HTML itself, and XHTML (which are gaining in popularity as processing power in mobile devices increases). WML was first released in 1998.&nbsp;[†](#w-wml)

Work in Progress
: Work currently being worked on.

Workaround
: A bypass of a recognized problem or limitation in a system or a policy. A workaround is typically a temporary fix that implies that a genuine solution to the problem is needed. But workarounds are frequently as creative as true solutions, involving outside the box thinking in their creation. Typically they are considered brittle in that they will not respond well to further pressure from a system beyond the original design. In implementing a workaround it is important to flag the change so as to later implement a proper solution. A “workaround” can also be a euphemism for a “hack.”&nbsp;[†](#w-workaround)

World Wide Web
: An information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the WWW are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by a software application called a web server. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.&nbsp;[†](#w-www)

World Wide Web Consortium
: The main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations which maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web. The consortium also engages in education and outreach, develops software, and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.&nbsp;[†](#w-w3c) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org](https://www.w3.org/)

WorldWideWeb
: The first web browser and editor, later renamed “Nexus.” WorldWideWeb was discontinued in 1994. At the time it was written, it was the sole web browser in existence, as well as the first WYSIWYG HTML editor.&nbsp;[†](#w-worldwideweb)

WPO

Wrapper
: In software development, a subroutine in a software library or a computer program whose main purpose is to call a second subroutine or a system call with little or no additional computation. Wrapper functions are used to make writing computer programs easier by abstracting away the details of a subroutine’s underlying implementation.&nbsp;[†](#w-wrapper-function)
: In web development, another name for a higher-level container, usually covering a major section of a document with many child elements.

Write Once, Run Anywhere
: A slogan created by Sun Microsystems to illustrate the cross-platform benefits of the Java language. Ideally, this meant that a Java program could be developed on any device, compiled into a standard bytecode, and be expected to run on any device equipped with a Java virtual machine (JVM). The installation of a JVM or Java interpreter on chips, devices, or software packages became an industry standard practice.&nbsp;[†](#w-wora)
