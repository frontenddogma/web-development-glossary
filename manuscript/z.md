Zero-indexed
: A way of numbering in which the initial element of a sequence is assigned the index 0, rather than the index 1 as is typical in everyday non-mathematical or non-programming circumstances. Under zero-indexed or zero-based numbering, the initial element is sometimes termed the zeroth element, rather than the first element; zeroth is a coined ordinal number corresponding to the number zero.&nbsp;[†](#w-zero-indexed)

ZIP
: An archive file format that supports lossless data compression. A ZIP file may contain one or more files or directories that may have been compressed. The ZIP file format permits a number of compression algorithms, though DEFLATE is the most common. ZIP was releasedin 1989 by Phil Katz.&nbsp;[†](#w-zip)
