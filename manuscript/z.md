Z shell
: A Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. Zsh is an extended Bourne shell with many improvements, including features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh. [†](#w-zsh)

Zero-based indexing
: A way of numbering in which the initial element of a sequence is assigned the index 0, rather than the index 1 as is typical in everyday non-mathematical or non-programming circumstances. Under zero-indexed or zero-based numbering, the initial element is sometimes termed the “zeroth” element, rather than the first element; “zeroth” is a coined ordinal number corresponding to the number zero. [†](#w-zero-based-indexing)

Zero-configuration networking
: A set of technologies that automatically creates a usable computer network based on the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) when computers or network peripherals are interconnected. Zeroconf does not require manual operator intervention or special configuration servers. Without it, a network administrator must set up network services, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS), or configure each computer’s network settings manually. Zeroconf is built on three core technologies: automatic assignment of numeric network addresses for networked devices, automatic distribution and resolution of computer hostnames, and automatic location of network services, such as printing devices. [†](#w-zeroconf)

ZIP
: An archive file format that supports lossless data compression. A ZIP file may contain one or more files or directories that may have been compressed. The ZIP file format permits a number of compression algorithms, though DEFLATE is the most common. ZIP was released in 1989 by Phil Katz. [†](#w-zip)

Zombie cookie
: An HTTP cookie that is recreated after deletion, usually from backups stored outside the web browser’s dedicated cookie storage. A zombie cookie may be stored online or directly onto a visitor’s computer, in a breach of browser security and making it difficult to remove. Zombie cookies may be installed on a web browser that has opted not to receive cookies. [†](#w-zombie-cookie)

Zone file
: A text file that describes a Domain Name System (DNS) zone. A DNS zone is a subset, often a single domain, of the hierarchical domain name structure of the DNS. The zone file contains mappings between domain names and IP addresses and other resources, organized in the form of text representations of resource records (RR). A zone file may be either a DNS master file, authoritatively describing a zone, or it may be used to list the contents of a DNS cache. Zone files were first introduced in 1987. [†](#w-zone-file)
