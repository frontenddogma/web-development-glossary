Zero-based indexing
: A way of numbering in which the initial element of a sequence is assigned the index 0, rather than the index 1 as is typical in everyday non-mathematical or non-programming circumstances. Under zero-indexed or zero-based numbering, the initial element is sometimes termed the “zeroth” element, rather than the first element; “zeroth” is a coined ordinal number corresponding to the number zero.&nbsp;[†](#w-zero-based-indexing)
