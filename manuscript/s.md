Sass
: A preprocessor scripting language. Sass is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called “the indented syntax,” uses a syntax similar to Haml. It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, “SCSS” (Sassy CSS), uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively. Sass was developed in 2006 by Hampton Catlin and Natalie Weizenbaum.&nbsp;[†](#w-sass) ℹ︎&nbsp;[sass-lang.com](https://sass-lang.com/)

SassScript
: The scripting language used with Sass. SassScript provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, and selector inheritance.&nbsp;[†](#w-sass)

Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS
: A CSS style guide. SMACSS was developed in 2011 by Jonathan Snook. ℹ︎&nbsp;[smacss.com](http://smacss.com/)

Scalable Vector Graphics
: An XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999. SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files. This means that they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/SVG2](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/)

Scope
: The region of a computer program where a name binding is valid, that is, where the name can be used to refer to the entity. Such a region is referred to as a scope block. In other parts of the program the name may refer to a different entity (it may have a different binding), or to nothing at all (it may be unbound). The scope of a binding is also known as the visibility of an entity. A scope is a part of a program that can be the scope for a set of bindings—a precise definition is tricky, but in casual use and in practice largely corresponds to a block, a function, or a file, depending on language and type of entity. The term “scope” is also used to refer to the set of all entities that are visible or names that are valid within a portion of the program or at a given point in a program, which is more correctly referred to as context or environment. Strictly speaking, “part of a program” refers to “portion of the source code (area of text),” and is known as lexical scope. In some languages, however, “part of a program” refers to “portion of run time (time period during execution),” and is known as dynamic scope.&nbsp;[†](#w-scope)

Scoped styles
: A concept to contain styles only to a certain element as well as its children (as opposed to have them affect other elements as well). The corresponding `scoped` attribute was specified but not standardized in favor of other approaches like Web Components. Frameworks like Vue support both concept and attribute.

Screen reader
: A form of assistive technology that is essential to people who are blind, as well as useful to people who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning disability. Screen readers are software applications that attempt to convey what people with normal eyesight see on a display to their users via non-visual means, like text-to-speech, sound icons, or a Braille device. They do this by applying a wide variety of techniques that include for example interacting with dedicated Accessibility API, using various operating system features (like inter-process communication and querying user interface properties) and employing hooking techniques.&nbsp;[†](#w-screen-reader)

Script
: Code, usually small programs, written in a scripting language.

Scripting language
: A programming language for a special run-time environment that automates the execution of tasks; the tasks could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted (rather than compiled). A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment. The term “scripting language” is also used loosely to refer to dynamic high-level general-purpose languages, such as Perl, PowerShell, Python, and Tcl. The spectrum of scripting languages ranges from very small and highly domain-specific languages to general-purpose programming languages used for scripting. Standard examples of scripting languages for specific environments include: Bash, for the Unix or Unix-like operating systems; ECMAScript (JavaScript), for web browsers; and Visual Basic for Applications, for Microsoft Office applications.&nbsp;[†](#w-scripting-language)

Scroll Snap
: A CSS module that introduces scroll snap positions, which enforce the scroll positions that a scroll container’s scrollport may end at after a scrolling operation has completed.&nbsp;[‡](#m-scroll-snap) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap-1](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap-1/)

Scrolling
: Sliding text, images, or video across a monitor or display, vertically or horizontally. “Scrolling” as such does not change the layout of the text or pictures but moves (pans or tilts) the user’s view across what is apparently a larger image that is not wholly seen.&nbsp;[†](#w-scrolling)

Scrum
: An Agile process framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields and is slowly starting to be explored for other complex work, like research and advanced technologies. Scrum is designed for small teams which break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called Sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called Daily Scrums.&nbsp;[†](#w-scrum) ℹ︎&nbsp;[scrumguides.org](https://www.scrumguides.org/)

Scrum Master
: A Scrum role that is accountable for guiding, coaching, and helping a Scrum Team and its environment to use Scrum.

Scrum Team
: A self-organizing and cross-functional team consisting of Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.

Scrum Values
: The values that the Scrum framework revolves around: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.

SEA
: → Search Engine Advertising

SeaMonkey
: An Internet suite bundling web browser, an email, newsgroup, and feed client, an IRC chat, and an HTML editor. SeaMonkey is the continuation of the former Mozilla Application Suite, based on the same source code, which itself grew out of Netscape Communicator and formed the base of Netscape&nbsp;6 and Netscape&nbsp;7. SeaMonkey was created in 2005 after the Mozilla Foundation decided to focus on the standalone projects Firefox and Thunderbird. The development of SeaMonkey is community-driven.&nbsp;[†](#w-seamonkey) ℹ︎&nbsp;[seamonkey-project.org](https://www.seamonkey-project.org/)

Search Engine Advertising
: The purchasing and managing of advertisements in online search engines and their content networks.

Search engine indexing
: The collecting, parsing, and storing data to facilitate fast and accurate information retrieval. Index design incorporates interdisciplinary concepts from linguistics, cognitive psychology, mathematics, informatics, and computer science. Popular search engines focus on the full-text indexing of online, natural language documents. Media types such as video, audio, and graphics are also searchable.&nbsp;[†](#w-search-engine-indexing)

Search Engine Marketing
: A form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs) primarily through paid advertising. SEM may incorporate search engine optimization (SEO), which adjusts or rewrites website content and site architecture to achieve a higher ranking in search engine results pages to enhance pay per click (PPC) listings.&nbsp;[†](#w-sem)

Search Engine Optimization
: The process of increasing the quality and quantity of website traffic by increasing the visibility of a website or a web page to users of a web search engine. SEO refers to the improvement of unpaid results (known as “natural” or “organic” results) and excludes direct traffic and visitors as well as the purchase of paid placement. SEO may target different kinds of searches, including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, adding content, and modifying HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic.&nbsp;[†](#w-seo)

Search Engine Results Page
: The results web page(s) of a search engine, in response to a search query.

Searching
: A research and navigation strategy. The other of the two major ways of interacting with the Web, the other one being browsing or surfing.

Sectioning content
: Content that defines the scope of headings and footers, marked up through the `article`, `aside`, `nav`, and `section` elements. Each sectioning content element potentially has a heading and an outline.&nbsp;§

Secure Shell
: A cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Typical applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH. SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server. The protocol specification distinguishes between two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The standard TCP port for SSH is 22.&nbsp;[†](#w-ssh)

Secure Sockets Layer
: The deprecated predecessor to Transport Layer Security (TLS), a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. SSL was developed from 1995 to 1998.&nbsp;[†](#w-tls)

Security
: → Information Security

Security hacker
: Someone who explores methods for breaching defenses and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network. Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit, protest, information gathering, challenge, recreation, or to evaluate system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against potential hackers. The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the “computer underground.” Longstanding controversy surrounds the meaning of the term “hacker” itself.&nbsp;[†](#w-security-hacker)

security.txt
: A proposed standard for website security information that is meant to allow security researchers to easily report security vulnerabilities. The standard prescribes a text file called “security.txt” that is similar to robots.txt but intended to be read by humans wishing to contact a website’s owner about security issues.&nbsp;[†](#w-securitytxt)

Selector
: A pattern matching rule and the first part of a CSS rule. Selectors are used to target HTML elements as well as, generally speaking, elements of other markup languages that are to be styled. The case-sensitivity of selectors depends on the document (markup) language.&nbsp;[‡](#m-selector)

Selenium
: A cross-platform portable framework for testing web applications. Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language (Selenium IDE). It also provides a test domain-specific language (Selenese) to write tests in a number of popular programming languages, including C#, Groovy, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Scala. The tests can then run against most modern web browsers.&nbsp;[†](#w-selenium) ℹ︎&nbsp;[selenium.dev](https://selenium.dev/)

Semantic Versioning
: A particular versioning scheme. SemVer uses a sequence of three digits (`Major.Minor.Patch`), an optional pre-release tag and optional build meta tag. In this scheme, risk, and functionality are the measures of significance. Breaking changes are indicated by increasing the major number (high risk), new non-breaking features increment the minor number (medium risk) and all other non-breaking changes increment the patch number (lowest risk). The presence of a pre-release tag (`-alpha`, `-beta`) indicates substantial risk, as does a major number of zero (`0.y.z`), which is used to indicate a work-in-progress that may contain any level of potentially breaking changes (highest risk).&nbsp;[†](#w-versioning) ℹ︎&nbsp;[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

Semantics
: For markup languages, the meaning of elements, element groups, and microformats.
: For programming languages, the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages. It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically valid strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation.&nbsp;[†](#w-semantics)

Separation of Concerns
: A design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections such that each section addresses a separate concern. A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as “the details of the hardware for an application,” or as specific as “the name of which class to instantiate.” A program that embodies SoC well is called a modular program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by encapsulating information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of information hiding. Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer). Separation of concerns results in more degrees of freedom for some aspect of the program’s design, deployment, or usage.&nbsp;[†](#w-soc)

Server
: A server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called clients. This architecture is called the client-server model, and a single overall computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called services, such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device. Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers. Client-server systems are today most frequently implemented by (and often identified with) the request-response model.&nbsp;[†](#w-server)

Server cluster
: → Cluster
: → Server farm

Server farm
: A collection of computer servers, usually maintained by an organization to supply server functionality far beyond the capability of a single machine. Server farms often consist of thousands of computers which require a large amount of power to run and to keep cool. At the optimum performance level, a server farm has enormous costs (both financial and environmental) associated with it. Server farms often have backup servers, which can take over the function of primary servers in the event of a primary-server failure. Server farms are typically collocated with the network switches or routers which enable communication between the different parts of the cluster and the users of the cluster.&nbsp;[†](#w-server-farm)

Server logs
: Log files related to server events. Server logs may be generated and stored on respective servers.

Server push
: → Push technology

Server side
: Operations on the server as opposed to the client side in a client-server relationship.&nbsp;[†](#w-server-side)

Server-Side Rendering
: A technique for rendering client-side Single-Page Applications (SPA) on the server, sending a fully-rendered page to the client. SSR is used to manage and alleviate the initial rendering when an app is first requested.

Service Level Agreement
: A commitment between a service provider and a client. Particular aspects of the service—quality, availability, responsibilities—are agreed between the service provider and the service user. The most common component of an SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract. As an example, Internet service providers and telcos will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level(s) of service being sold in plain language terms. In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition in mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to repair or mean time to recovery (MTTR); identifying which party is responsible for reporting faults or paying fees; responsibility for various data rates; throughput; jitter; or similar measurable details.&nbsp;[†](#w-sla)

Service Level Expectation
: The definition and setting of expectations of a service to be given, like what time it may take for work to be done, or issues to be resolved.

Service worker
: A JavaScript file that operates as a type of web worker. They work separately from the main browser thread to handle push notifications, synchronize data in the background, cache or retrieve resource requests, intercept network requests, and receive centralized updates. Service workers are used in an attempt to give progressive web apps the ability to provide the high performance and rich experience of native mobile apps, with the low storage space, real-time updates and improved search engine visibility of traditional web apps. Service workers go through a three-step lifecycle of Registration, Installation, and Activation. Technically, service workers provide a scriptable network proxy in the web browser to manage the web/HTTP requests programmatically. The service workers lie between the network and device to supply the content. They are capable of using the cache mechanisms efficiently and allow error-free behavior during offline periods.&nbsp;[†](#w-pwa)

Shadow host
: The element that a shadow tree is attached to, like the root element of a custom element.

Shadow root
: The topmost element of the shadow tree.

Shadow tree
: A tree of DOM nodes whose topmost node is a shadow root; that is, the topmost node within a shadow DOM. A shadow tree is a hidden set of standard DOM nodes which is attached to a standard DOM node that serves as a host. The hidden nodes are not directly visible using regular DOM functionality, but require the use of a special Shadow DOM API to access. Nodes within the shadow tree are not affected by anything applied outside the shadow tree, and vice versa. This provides a way to encapsulate implementation details, which is especially useful for custom elements and other advanced design paradigms.&nbsp;[‡](#m-shadow-tree)

Soft launch
: A preview release of a product or service to a limited audience prior to the general public. Soft-launching a product is sometimes used to gather data or feedback regarding its acceptance in the marketplace, prior to making it widely available during an official release or grand opening. A company may also choose a soft launch to test the functionality of a product, allowing adjustments to be made before a wider release and marketing efforts are implemented.&nbsp;[†](#w-soft-launch)

Software crisis
: A term used in the early days of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could now be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were inadequate. The term “software crisis” was coined by attendees at the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at Garmisch, Germany. Edsger Dijkstra’s 1972 ACM Turing Award Lecture makes reference to the same problem.&nbsp;[†](#w-software-crisis)

Superuser
: A special user account used for system administration. Depending on the operating system (OS), the actual name of this account might be root, administrator, admin or supervisor. In some cases, the actual name of the account is not the determining factor; on Unix-like systems, for example, the user with a user identifier (UID) of zero is the superuser, regardless of the name of that account; and in systems which implement a role based security model, any user with the role of superuser (or its synonyms) can carry out all actions of the superuser account. The principle of least privilege recommends that most users and applications run under an ordinary account to perform their work, as a superuser account is capable of making unrestricted, potentially adverse, system-wide changes.&nbsp;[†](#w-superuser)

A human example is the telephone—during a telephone call one tends to respond to another person immediately. Many programming commands are also synchronous—for example, when one types in a calculation, the environment will return the result instantly, unless programmed not to.&nbsp;[‡](#m-synchronous)

Syndication
: As web syndication, a form of syndication in which content is made available from one website to other sites and services.

The term “syndication” may also describe other kinds of content licensing for reuse.&nbsp;[†](#w-syndication)

Syntax
: The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in a language. This applies both to programming languages, where the document represents source code, and to markup languages, where the document represents data. The syntax of a language defines its surface form. Text-based computer languages are based on sequences of characters, while visual programming languages are based on the spatial layout and connections between symbols (which may be textual or graphical). Documents that are syntactically invalid are said to have a syntax error. When designing the syntax of a language, a designer might start by writing down examples of both legal and illegal strings, before trying to figure out the general rules from these examples.&nbsp;[†](#w-syntax)
