Sass
: A preprocessor scripting language. Sass is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called “the indented syntax,” uses a syntax similar to Haml. It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, “SCSS” (Sassy CSS), uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively. Sass was developed in 2006 by Hampton Catlin and Natalie Weizenbaum.&nbsp;[†](#w-sass) ℹ︎&nbsp;[sass-lang.com](https://sass-lang.com/)

SassScript
: The scripting language used with Sass. SassScript provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, and selector inheritance.&nbsp;[†](#w-sass)

Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS
: A CSS style guide. SMACSS was developed in 2011 by Jonathan Snook. ℹ︎&nbsp;[smacss.com](http://smacss.com/)

Scalable Vector Graphics
: An XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999. SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files. This means that they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/SVG2](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/)

Scope
: The region of a computer program where a name binding is valid, that is, where the name can be used to refer to the entity. Such a region is referred to as a scope block. In other parts of the program the name may refer to a different entity (it may have a different binding), or to nothing at all (it may be unbound). The scope of a binding is also known as the visibility of an entity. A scope is a part of a program that can be the scope for a set of bindings—a precise definition is tricky, but in casual use and in practice largely corresponds to a block, a function, or a file, depending on language and type of entity. The term “scope” is also used to refer to the set of all entities that are visible or names that are valid within a portion of the program or at a given point in a program, which is more correctly referred to as context or environment. Strictly speaking, “part of a program” refers to “portion of the source code (area of text),” and is known as lexical scope. In some languages, however, “part of a program” refers to “portion of run time (time period during execution),” and is known as dynamic scope.&nbsp;[†](#w-scope)

Screen reader
: A form of assistive technology that is essential to people who are blind, as well as useful to people who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning disability. Screen readers are software applications that attempt to convey what people with normal eyesight see on a display to their users via non-visual means, like text-to-speech, sound icons, or a Braille device. They do this by applying a wide variety of techniques that include for example interacting with dedicated Accessibility API, using various operating system features (like inter-process communication and querying user interface properties) and employing hooking techniques.&nbsp;[†](#w-screen-reader)

Script
: Code, usually small programs, written in a scripting language.

Scripting language
: A programming language for a special run-time environment that automates the execution of tasks; the tasks could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted (rather than compiled). A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment. The term “scripting language” is also used loosely to refer to dynamic high-level general-purpose languages, such as Perl, PowerShell, Python, and Tcl. The spectrum of scripting languages ranges from very small and highly domain-specific languages to general-purpose programming languages used for scripting. Standard examples of scripting languages for specific environments include: Bash, for the Unix or Unix-like operating systems; ECMAScript (JavaScript), for web browsers; and Visual Basic for Applications, for Microsoft Office applications.&nbsp;[†](#w-scripting-language)

Scroll Snap
: A CSS module that introduces scroll snap positions, which enforce the scroll positions that a scroll container’s scrollport may end at after a scrolling operation has completed.&nbsp;[‡](#m-scroll-snap) ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap-1](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scroll-snap-1/)

Scrolling
: Sliding text, images, or video across a monitor or display, vertically or horizontally. “Scrolling” as such does not change the layout of the text or pictures but moves (pans or tilts) the user’s view across what is apparently a larger image that is not wholly seen.&nbsp;[†](#w-scrolling)

Scrum
: An Agile process framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields and is slowly starting to be explored for other complex work, like research and advanced technologies. Scrum is designed for small teams which break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called Sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called Daily Scrums.&nbsp;[†](#w-scrum) ℹ︎&nbsp;[scrumguides.org](https://www.scrumguides.org/)

Scrum Master
: A Scrum role that is accountable for guiding, coaching, and helping a Scrum Team and its environment to use Scrum.

Scrum Team
: A self-organizing and cross-functional team consisting of Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.

Scrum Values
: The values that the Scrum framework revolves around: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.

SEA
: → Search Engine Advertising

SeaMonkey
: An Internet suite bundling web browser, an email, newsgroup, and feed client, an IRC chat, and an HTML editor. SeaMonkey is the continuation of the former Mozilla Application Suite, based on the same source code, which itself grew out of Netscape Communicator and formed the base of Netscape&nbsp;6 and Netscape&nbsp;7. SeaMonkey was created in 2005 after the Mozilla Foundation decided to focus on the standalone projects Firefox and Thunderbird. The development of SeaMonkey is community-driven.&nbsp;[†](#w-seamonkey) ℹ︎&nbsp;[seamonkey-project.org](https://www.seamonkey-project.org/)

Search Engine Advertising
: The purchasing and managing of advertisements in online search engines and their content networks.

Search engine indexing
: The collecting, parsing, and storing data to facilitate fast and accurate information retrieval. Index design incorporates interdisciplinary concepts from linguistics, cognitive psychology, mathematics, informatics, and computer science. Popular search engines focus on the full-text indexing of online, natural language documents. Media types such as video, audio, and graphics are also searchable.&nbsp;[†](#w-search-engine-indexing)

Search Engine Marketing
: A form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs) primarily through paid advertising. SEM may incorporate search engine optimization (SEO), which adjusts or rewrites website content and site architecture to achieve a higher ranking in search engine results pages to enhance pay per click (PPC) listings.&nbsp;[†](#w-sem)

Search Engine Optimization
: The process of increasing the quality and quantity of website traffic by increasing the visibility of a website or a web page to users of a web search engine. SEO refers to the improvement of unpaid results (known as "natural" or "organic" results) and excludes direct traffic and visitors as well as the purchase of paid placement.  SEO may target different kinds of searches, including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, adding content, and modifying HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic.&nbsp;[†](#w-seo)

Search Engine Results Page
: The results web page(s) of a search engine, in response to a search query.

Searching
: A research and navigation strategy. The other of the two major ways of interacting with the Web, the other one being browsing or surfing.

Sectioning content
: Content that defines the scope of headings and footers, marked up through the `article`, `aside`, `nav`, and `section` elements. Each sectioning content element potentially has a heading and an outline.&nbsp;§

Secure Shell
: A cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Typical applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH. SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client–server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server. The protocol specification distinguishes between two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The standard TCP port for SSH is 22.&nbsp;[†](#w-ssh)

Secure Sockets Layer
: The deprecated predecessor to Transport Layer Security (TLS), a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. SSL was developed from 1995 to 1998.&nbsp;[†](#w-tls)

: → Information Security

Security hacker
: Someone who explores methods for breaching defenses and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network. Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit, protest, information gathering, challenge, recreation, or to evaluate system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against potential hackers. The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the “computer underground.” Longstanding controversy surrounds the meaning of the term “hacker” itself.&nbsp;[†](#w-security-hacker)

security.txt
: A proposed standard for website security information that is meant to allow security researchers to easily report security vulnerabilities. The standard prescribes a text file called “security.txt” that is similar to robots.txt but intended to be read by humans wishing to contact a website’s owner about security issues.&nbsp;[†](#w-securitytxt)

Soft launch
: A preview release of a product or service to a limited audience prior to the general public. Soft-launching a product is sometimes used to gather data or feedback regarding its acceptance in the marketplace, prior to making it widely available during an official release or grand opening. A company may also choose a soft launch to test the functionality of a product, allowing adjustments to be made before a wider release and marketing efforts are implemented.&nbsp;[†](#w-soft-launch)

Software crisis
: A term used in the early days of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could now be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were inadequate. The term “software crisis” was coined by attendees at the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at Garmisch, Germany. Edsger Dijkstra’s 1972 ACM Turing Award Lecture makes reference to the same problem.&nbsp;[†](#w-software-crisis)

Software framework
: An abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and it is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or system.&nbsp;[†](#w-software-framework)

Superuser
: A special user account used for system administration. Depending on the operating system (OS), the actual name of this account might be root, administrator, admin or supervisor. In some cases, the actual name of the account is not the determining factor; on Unix-like systems, for example, the user with a user identifier (UID) of zero is the superuser, regardless of the name of that account; and in systems which implement a role based security model, any user with the role of superuser (or its synonyms) can carry out all actions of the superuser account. The principle of least privilege recommends that most users and applications run under an ordinary account to perform their work, as a superuser account is capable of making unrestricted, potentially adverse, system-wide changes.&nbsp;[†](#w-superuser)
