Scope
: The region of a computer program where a name binding is valid, that is, where the name can be used to refer to the entity. Such a region is referred to as a scope block. In other parts of the program the name may refer to a different entity (it may have a different binding), or to nothing at all (it may be unbound). The scope of a binding is also known as the visibility of an entity. A scope is a part of a program that can be the scope for a set of bindings—a precise definition is tricky, but in casual use and in practice largely corresponds to a block, a function, or a file, depending on language and type of entity. The term “scope” is also used to refer to the set of all entities that are visible or names that are valid within a portion of the program or at a given point in a program, which is more correctly referred to as context or environment. Strictly speaking, “part of a program” refers to “portion of the source code (area of text),” and is known as lexical scope. In some languages, however, “part of a program” refers to “portion of run time (time period during execution),” and is known as dynamic scope.&nbsp;[†](#w-scope)

Search engine indexing
: The collecting, parsing, and storing data to facilitate fast and accurate information retrieval. Index design incorporates interdisciplinary concepts from linguistics, cognitive psychology, mathematics, informatics, and computer science. Popular search engines focus on the full-text indexing of online, natural language documents. Media types such as video, audio, and graphics are also searchable.&nbsp;[†](#w-search-engine-indexing)

Security hacker
: Someone who explores methods for breaching defenses and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network. Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit, protest, information gathering, challenge, recreation, or to evaluate system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against potential hackers. The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the “computer underground.” Longstanding controversy surrounds the meaning of the term “hacker” itself.&nbsp;[†](#w-security-hacker)

Soft launch
: A preview release of a product or service to a limited audience prior to the general public. Soft-launching a product is sometimes used to gather data or feedback regarding its acceptance in the marketplace, prior to making it widely available during an official release or grand opening. A company may also choose a soft launch to test the functionality of a product, allowing adjustments to be made before a wider release and marketing efforts are implemented.&nbsp;[†](#w-soft-launch)

Software crisis
: A term used in the early days of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could now be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were inadequate. The term “software crisis” was coined by attendees at the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at Garmisch, Germany. Edsger Dijkstra’s 1972 ACM Turing Award Lecture makes reference to the same problem.&nbsp;[†](#w-software-crisis)

Software framework
: An abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and it is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or system.&nbsp;[†](#w-software-framework)

Stack
