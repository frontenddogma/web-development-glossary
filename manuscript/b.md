Best practice
: A method or technique that has been generally accepted as superior to any alternatives because it produces results that are superior to those achieved by other means or because it has become a standard way of doing things, e.g., a standard way of complying with legal or ethical requirements. Best practices are used to maintain quality as an alternative to mandatory legislated standards.&nbsp;[†](#w-best-practice)

Bézier curve
: A parametric curve, mathematically based on Bernstein polynomials, that is defined by a set of control points P~0~ through P~n~, where _n_ is called its order, and where the first and last points are always the end points of the curve, and where intermediate control points (if any) generally do not lie on the curve. Named after Pierre Bézier (1910–1999).&nbsp;[†](#w-bezier-curve)

Bookmark
: A URI that is stored for later retrieval in any of various storage formats. All modern web browsers include bookmark features. Bookmarks are normally accessed through a menu in the user’s web browser, and folders are commonly used for organization.&nbsp;[†](#w-bookmark) 

Boolean
: A data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false) which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. It is named after George Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century.

Box model

Box model hack
: A popular early 2000’s workaround for Internet Explorer 5/5.5’s incorrect support of the CSS box model.

Browser
: A software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and displays the resulting web page on the user’s device. As of March 2019, more than 4.3 billion people use a browser, which is about 55% of the world’s population. The three most popular browsers are Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.&nbsp;[†](#w-browser)

Browser engine
: A core software component of every major web browser. The primary job of a browser engine is to transform HTML documents and other resources of a web page into an interactive visual representation on a user’s device. Besides “browser engine,” two other terms are in common use regarding related concepts: “layout engine” and “rendering engine.” In theory, layout and rendering (or “painting”) could be handled by separate engines. In practice, however, they are tightly coupled and rarely considered separately.&nbsp;[†](#w-browser-engine)

Browser Helper Object
: A DLL module designed as a plugin for Microsoft’s Internet Explorer web browser to provide added functionality. BHOs were introduced in October 1997 with the release of version 4 of Internet Explorer. Most BHOs are loaded once by each new instance of Internet Explorer. BHOs are still supported as of Windows 10, through Internet Explorer 11, while BHOs are not supported in the default web browser Microsoft Edge.&nbsp;[†](#w-bho)

Browser War
: A market competitions between web browsers, usually referring to the First Browser War (1995–2001) between Internet Explorer (Microsoft) and Navigator (Netscape) or the Second Browser War (2004–2017) between Internet Explorer, Firefox (Mozilla), and Chrome (Google).

Browsing context
: The environment in which a browser displays a document, as with a tab, window, or frame. Each browsing context has a specific origin, the origin of the active document, and a history that lists all the displayed documents in order. Communication between browsing contexts is severely restricted.&nbsp;[‡](#m-browsing-context)

Buffer
: A storage in physical memory used to temporarily store data while it is being transferred from one place to another.&nbsp;[‡](#m-buffer)

Bug
: A error, flaw, or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Most bugs arise from mistakes and errors made in either a program’s source code or its design.&nbsp;[†](#w-bug)

Byte Order Mark
: A particular use of a special Unicode character, `U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK`, whose appearance as a magic number at the start of a text stream can signal several things to a program reading the text: the byte order, or endianness, of the text stream in the cases of 16-bit and 32-bit encodings; the fact that the text stream’s encoding is Unicode, to a high level of confidence; or which Unicode character encoding is used.&nbsp;[†](#w-bom)
