Backend
: The data access layer of software of a piece of software, usually covering business logic and data storage. In the client-server model, the server is considered the back end.&nbsp;[†](#w-frontend-backend)

Backlink
: A link from one web resource (the referrer) to another web resource (the referent), made by an anchor, as viewed from the web resource being referred to. Other words for “backlink” are “incoming link,” “inbound link,” “inlink,” “inward link,” and “citation.”&nbsp;[†](#w-backlink)

Banner
: An online advertising format, usually a horizontal or vertical rectangle in standardized sizes.

Base64
: A group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. The term “Base64” originates from a specific MIME content transfer encoding. Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data. Three 8-bit bytes (i.e., a total of 24 bits) can therefore be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits. Common to all binary-to-text encoding schemes, Base64 is designed to carry data stored in binary formats across channels that only reliably support text content. Base64 is particularly prevalent on the World Wide Web where its uses include the ability to embed image files or other binary assets inside textual assets such as HTML and CSS files.&nbsp;[†](#w-base64)

Bash
: A Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989, Bash has been used widely as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and Apple’s macOS Mojave and earlier versions.&nbsp;[†](#w-bash)

Basic Multilingual Plane
: The first Unicode plane, plane 0, containing characters for almost all modern languages, and a large number of symbols. A primary objective for the BMP is to support the unification of prior character sets as well as characters for writing. Most of the assigned code points in the BMP are used to encode Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) characters.&nbsp;[†](#w-plane)

BDD
: → Behavior-Driven Development

Behavior
: In web development, the code that deals with how content can be interacted with. This is often achieved through JavaScript.

Behavior-Driven Development
: An agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical or business participants in a software project. BDD encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. It emerged from Test-Driven Development (TDD). BDD combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.&nbsp;[†](#w-bdd)

Below the fold
: The part of a web page that is visible only after scrolling.

BEM
: → Block Element Modifier

Best practice
: A method or technique that has been generally accepted as superior to any alternatives because it produces results that are superior to those achieved by other means or because it has become a standard way of doing things, e.g., a standard way of complying with legal or ethical requirements. Best practices are used to maintain quality as an alternative to mandatory legislated standards.&nbsp;[†](#w-best-practice)

Bézier curve
: A parametric curve, mathematically based on Bernstein polynomials, that is defined by a set of control points P~0~ through P~n~, where _n_ is called its order, and where the first and last points are always the end points of the curve, and where intermediate control points (if any) generally do not lie on the curve. Named after Pierre Bézier (1910–1999).&nbsp;[†](#w-bezier-curve)

BHO

: An integral data type of 64 bits, with a signed range from –9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, and an unsigned range from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.

Big O notation
: A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmann-Landau notation or asymptotic notation. In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. In analytic number theory, big O notation is often used to express a bound on the difference between an arithmetical function and a better understood approximation.&nbsp;[†](#w-big-o)

Binary chop
: → Binary search algorithm

Binary number
: A number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically “0” (zero) and “1” (one).&nbsp;[†](#w-binary-number)

Binary search algorithm
: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.&nbsp;[†](#w-binary-search-algorithm)

Binding
: The association of entities (data or code) with identifiers. An identifier bound to an object is said to reference that object. Machine languages have no built-in notion of identifiers, but name-object bindings as a service and notation for the programmer is implemented by programming languages. Binding is intimately connected with scoping, as scope determines which names bind to which objects—at which locations in the program code (lexically) and in which one of the possible execution paths (temporally).&nbsp;[†](#w-binding)

Bitmap
: A raster graphics image file format used to store bitmap digital images, independently of the display device (such as a graphics adapter). Also known as bitmap image file or device independent bitmap (DIB) file format.&nbsp;[†](#w-bitmap)

Black-box testing is sometimes referred to as specification-based testing.&nbsp;[†](#w-black-box-testing)

Blacklist
: A basic access control mechanism that allows through all elements (email addresses, users, passwords, URLs, IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, etc.), except those explicitly mentioned. Those items on the list are denied access. The opposite of a blacklist is a whitelist.&nbsp;[†](#w-blacklist)

Blog
: A discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, “multi-author blogs” (MABs) emerged.&nbsp;[†](#w-blog)

Blogging
: The act of running a blog, and writing posts for a blog.

Blogosphere

Boolean
: A data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false) which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. It is named after George Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid-19th century. The Boolean data type is primarily associated with conditional statements.&nbsp;[†](#w-boolean)

Bootstrap
: An HTML/CSS framework. ℹ︎&nbsp;[getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/)

: Per the CSS box model, any kind of line (solid, dotted, dashed, etc.) surrounding an element of a document, if present. The border area lies between the padding and margin areas of a box.

Bottom-posting
: A posting style in which the reply follows the quote.&nbsp;[†](#w-posting-style)

Bounce rate
: A marketing term used in web traffic analysis that represents the percentage of visitors who enter a site and then leave (“bounce”) rather than continue to view other pages within the same site. The bounce rate is calculated by counting the number of single page visits and dividing that by the total visits. It is then represented as a percentage of total visits.&nbsp;[†](#w-bounce-rate)

Bound variable
: A variable that was previously free, but has been bound to a specific value or set of values.&nbsp;[†](#w-free-bound-variable)

Boundary value problem

Box model hack
: A popular early 2000’s workaround for Internet Explorer 5/5.5’s incorrect support of the CSS box model. The box model hack was obsoleted by improved browser implementations and an additional CSS property (`box-sizing`). ℹ︎&nbsp;[is.gd/nZKbJw](https://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/boxmodelhack.html)

Boyscout Rule
: The idea to “always leave code better than you found it,” which may be [attributable to Robert C. Martin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/ch08.html).

Bracket notation
: One of two ways to access object properties in JavaScript (`objectName['propertyName']`), the other being dot notation.

Braille (⠃⠗⠁⠊⠇⠇⠑)
: A tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired. Braille is traditionally written with embossed paper. Braille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports using refreshable braille displays. They can write braille with the original slate and stylus or type it on a braille writer, such as a portable braille notetaker or computer that prints with a braille embosser. Braille was developed by Louis Braille in 1824, who published it in 1829.&nbsp;[†](#w-braille)

Branch
: A duplicate of an object under version control. Branches are also known as trees, streams, or codelines. The originating branch is sometimes called the parent branch, the upstream branch (or simply upstream, especially if the branches are maintained by different organizations or individuals), or the backing stream. Child branches are branches that have a parent; a branch without a parent is referred to as the trunk or the mainline.&nbsp;[†](#w-branching)

Branching
: The duplication of an object under version control (such as a source code file or a directory tree) so that modifications can occur in parallel along multiple branches. Branching generally implies the ability to later merge or integrate changes back onto the parent branch.&nbsp;[†](#w-branching)

Breadcrumb
: A graphical control element frequently used as a navigational aid in user interfaces and on web pages. It allows users to keep track and maintain awareness of their locations within programs, documents, or websites.&nbsp;[†](#w-breadcrumb)

Broken link
: A hyperlink that does not work, or work anymore, that is, that points to a target that is not available. Broken links constitute link rot.

Brotli
: A data format specification for data streams compressed with a specific combination of the general-purpose LZ77 lossless compression algorithm, Huffman coding, and second-order context modeling.&nbsp;[†](#w-brotli) ℹ︎&nbsp;[github.com/google/brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli)

Browser
: A software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and displays the resulting web page on the user’s device. As of March 2019, more than 4.3 billion people use a browser, which is about 55% of the world’s population. The three most popular browsers are Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.&nbsp;[†](#w-browser)

Browser detection
: → Browser sniffing

Browser engine
: A core software component of every major web browser. The primary job of a browser engine is to transform HTML documents and other resources of a web page into an interactive visual representation on a user’s device. Besides “browser engine,” two other terms are in common use regarding related concepts: “layout engine” and “rendering engine.” In theory, layout and rendering (or “painting”) could be handled by separate engines. In practice, however, they are tightly coupled and rarely considered separately.&nbsp;[†](#w-browser-engine)

Browser extension
: A small software module for customizing a web browser. Browsers typically allow a variety of extensions, including user interface modifications, ad blocking, and cookie management. Browser plugins are a separate type of module. The main difference is that extensions are usually just source code, but plugins are always executables (i.e., object code). As of 2019, plugins have been deprecated by most browsers, while extensions are widely used.&nbsp;[†](#w-browser-extension)

Browser Helper Object
: A DLL module designed as a plugin for Microsoft’s Internet Explorer web browser to provide added functionality. BHOs were introduced in 1997 with the release of Internet Explorer 4. Most BHOs are loaded once by each new instance of Internet Explorer. BHOs are still supported as of Windows 10, through Internet Explorer 11, while BHOs are not supported in the default web browser Microsoft Edge.&nbsp;[†](#w-bho)

Browser sniffing
: A set of techniques used in websites and web applications in order to determine the web browser a visitor is using, and to serve browser-appropriate content to the visitor. This practice is sometimes used to circumvent incompatibilities between browsers due to misinterpretation of HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), or the Document Object Model (DOM). While the World Wide Web Consortium maintains up-to-date central versions of some of the most important Web standards in the form of recommendations, in practice no vendor has developed a browser which adheres exactly to these standards. As a result, different browsers may display the same page differently, and browser sniffing was developed to detect the web browser in order to help ensure consistent display of content.&nbsp;[†](#w-browser-sniffing)

Browser testing
: The testing of websites and apps in different web browsers.

Browser War
: A market competition between web browsers, usually referring to the First Browser War (1995–2001) between Internet Explorer (Microsoft) and Navigator (Netscape) or the Second Browser War (2004–2017) between Internet Explorer, Firefox (Mozilla), and Chrome (Google).

Browsing
: A kind of orienting strategy to identify something of relevance. One of the two major ways of interacting with the Web, the other one being searching.&nbsp;[†](#w-browsing)

Browsing context
: The environment in which a browser displays a document, as with a tab, window, or frame. Each browsing context has a specific origin, the origin of the active document, and a history that lists all the displayed documents in order. Communication between browsing contexts is restricted.&nbsp;[‡](#m-browsing-context)

Buffer
: A storage in physical memory used to temporarily store data while it is being transferred from one place to another.&nbsp;[‡](#m-buffer)

Bug
: An error, flaw, or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Most bugs arise from mistakes and errors made in either a program’s source code or its design.&nbsp;[†](#w-bug)

Bug tracking system
: A software application that keeps track of reported software bugs in software development projects. It may be regarded as a type of issue tracking system. Many bug tracking systems allow end users to enter bug reports directly. Other systems are used only internally in a company or organization doing software development. Typically bug tracking systems are integrated with other project management software. A bug tracking system is usually a necessary component of a professional software development infrastructure.&nbsp;[†](#w-bug-tracking-system)

Bugfix

Bugzilla
: A web-based general-purpose bug tracking system and testing tool originally developed and used by the Mozilla project. Bugzilla was first released in 1998 by Netscape.&nbsp;[†](#w-bugzilla) ℹ︎&nbsp;[bugzilla.org](https://www.bugzilla.org/)

Build Verification Test
: → Smoke testing

Bundling
: The process of dynamically or statically merging (bundling) several files, notably JavaScript modules, for output to a client or a server. Bundling reduces the number of files and requests to be delivered to a client and thus helps improve performance.

BVT
: → Build Verification Test

Byte Order Mark
: A particular use of a special Unicode character, `U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK`, whose appearance as a magic number at the start of a text stream can signal several things to a program reading the text: the byte order, or endianness, of the text stream in the cases of 16-bit and 32-bit encodings; the fact that the text stream’s encoding is Unicode, to a high level of confidence; or which Unicode character encoding is used.&nbsp;[†](#w-bom)
