Backlink
: A link from one web resource (the referrer) to another web resource (the referent), made by an anchor, as viewed from the web resource being referred to. Other words for “backlink” are “incoming link,” “inbound link,” “inlink,” “inward link,” and “citation.”&nbsp;[†](#w-backlink)

BDD
: → Behavior-Driven Development

Behavior-Driven Development
: An Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical or business participants in a software project. BDD encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. It emerged from Test-Driven Development (TDD). BDD combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.&nbsp;[†](#w-bdd)

Below the fold
: The part of a web page that is visible only after scrolling.

BEM
: → Block Element Modifier

Best practice
: A method or technique that has been generally accepted as superior to any alternatives because it produces results that are superior to those achieved by other means or because it has become a standard way of doing things, e.g., a standard way of complying with legal or ethical requirements. Best practices are used to maintain quality as an alternative to mandatory legislated standards.&nbsp;[†](#w-best-practice)

Bézier curve
: A parametric curve, mathematically based on Bernstein polynomials, that is defined by a set of control points P~0~ through P~n~, where _n_ is called its order, and where the first and last points are always the end points of the curve, and where intermediate control points (if any) generally do not lie on the curve. Named after Pierre Bézier (1910–1999).&nbsp;[†](#w-bezier-curve)

BHO

Block container element
: An element whose principal box is a block container box.

Block element
: → Block container element

Block Element Modifier
: A naming convention for HTML and CSS classes. Block Element Modifier, or BEM, was introduced in 2005 by Yandex. ℹ︎&nbsp;[getbem.com](http://getbem.com/)

Boolean
: A data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false) which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra.

Bounce rate
: A marketing term used in web traffic analysis that represents the percentage of visitors who enter a site and then leave (“bounce”) rather than continue to view other pages within the same site. The bounce rate is calculated by counting the number of single page visits and dividing that by the total visits. It is then represented as a percentage of total visits.&nbsp;[†](#w-bounce-rate)

Bounding box
: The smallest possible rectangle (aligned with the axes of that element’s user coordinate system) that entirely encloses an element and its descendants.&nbsp;[‡](#m-bounding-box) 

Bourne shell
: A shell, or command-line interpreter, for computer operating systems. Developed by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs, it was a replacement for the Thompson shell, whose executable file had the same name (`sh`).

Border
: Any kind of line (solid, dotted, dashed, …) surrounding an element on a web page, if present.

Box
: The visual space occupied by an HTML element’s content.&nbsp;[†](#w-box-model)

Box model
: A concept for the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in the document tree and laid out according to the visual formatting model. The boxes consist of content, padding, border, and margin areas.

Box model hack
: A popular early 2000’s workaround for Internet Explorer 5/5.5’s incorrect support of the CSS box model. The box model hack was obsoleted by improved browser implementations and an additional CSS property (`box-sizing`). ℹ︎&nbsp;[tantek.com/CSS/Examples/boxmodelhack.html](https://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/boxmodelhack.html)

Boyscout Rule

Braille (⠃⠗⠁⠊⠇⠇⠑)
: A tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired. Braille is traditionally written with embossed paper. Braille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports using refreshable braille displays. They can write braille with the original slate and stylus or type it on a braille writer, such as a portable braille notetaker or computer that prints with a braille embosser. Braille was developed by Louis Braille in 1824, who published it in 1829.&nbsp;[†](#w-braille)

Branch
: A duplicate of an object under version control. Branches are also known as trees, streams or codelines. The originating branch is sometimes called the parent branch, the upstream branch (or simply upstream, especially if the branches are maintained by different organizations or individuals), or the backing stream. Child branches are branches that have a parent; a branch without a parent is referred to as the trunk or the mainline.&nbsp;[†](#w-branching)

Branching
: The duplication of an object under version control (such as a source code file or a directory tree) so that modifications can occur in parallel along multiple branches. Branching generally implies the ability to later merge or integrate changes back onto the parent branch.&nbsp;[†](#w-branching)

Browser
: A software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and displays the resulting web page on the user’s device. As of March 2019, more than 4.3 billion people use a browser, which is about 55% of the world’s population. The three most popular browsers are Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.&nbsp;[†](#w-browser)

Browser engine
: A core software component of every major web browser. The primary job of a browser engine is to transform HTML documents and other resources of a web page into an interactive visual representation on a user’s device. Besides “browser engine,” two other terms are in common use regarding related concepts: “layout engine” and “rendering engine.” In theory, layout and rendering (or “painting”) could be handled by separate engines. In practice, however, they are tightly coupled and rarely considered separately.&nbsp;[†](#w-browser-engine)

Browser Helper Object
: A DLL module designed as a plugin for Microsoft’s Internet Explorer web browser to provide added functionality. BHOs were introduced in October 1997 with the release of version 4 of Internet Explorer. Most BHOs are loaded once by each new instance of Internet Explorer. BHOs are still supported as of Windows 10, through Internet Explorer 11, while BHOs are not supported in the default web browser Microsoft Edge.&nbsp;[†](#w-bho)

Browser testing
: The testing of web sites and apps in different web browsers.

Browser War
: A market competitions between web browsers, usually referring to the First Browser War (1995–2001) between Internet Explorer (Microsoft) and Navigator (Netscape) or the Second Browser War (2004–2017) between Internet Explorer, Firefox (Mozilla), and Chrome (Google).

Browsing
: A kind of orienting strategy to identify something of relevance. One of the two major ways of interacting with the Web, the other one being searching.&nbsp;[†](#w-browsing)

Browsing context
: The environment in which a browser displays a document, as with a tab, window, or frame. Each browsing context has a specific origin, the origin of the active document, and a history that lists all the displayed documents in order. Communication between browsing contexts is severely restricted.&nbsp;[‡](#m-browsing-context)

Buffer
: A storage in physical memory used to temporarily store data while it is being transferred from one place to another.&nbsp;[‡](#m-buffer)

Bug
: A error, flaw, or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Most bugs arise from mistakes and errors made in either a program’s source code or its design.&nbsp;[†](#w-bug)

Byte Order Mark
: A particular use of a special Unicode character, `U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK`, whose appearance as a magic number at the start of a text stream can signal several things to a program reading the text: the byte order, or endianness, of the text stream in the cases of 16-bit and 32-bit encodings; the fact that the text stream’s encoding is Unicode, to a high level of confidence; or which Unicode character encoding is used.&nbsp;[†](#w-bom)
