# N

n-based indexing
: The option to freely choose the base index of an array. Usually programming languages allowing n-based indexing also allow negative index values and other scalar data types like enumerations, or characters may be used as an array index.&nbsp;[†](#w-array)

: → Binding

Namespace
: A namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organize objects of various kinds, so that these objects may be referred to by name. A namespace ensures that all the identifiers within it have unique names so that they can be easily identified. Prominent examples include file systems; programming languages that organize their variables and subroutines in namespaces; computer networks and distributed systems that assign names to resources, such as computers, printers, websites, (remote) files, etc.; and operating systems that partition kernel resources (process IDs, users, network sockets) by isolated namespaces to support virtualization containers.&nbsp;[†](#w-namespace)

NaN
: → Not a Number

Native
: Software or data formats that were designed to run on a particular system. In a more technical sense, native code is code written specifically for a certain processor. The only way to run this code on another processor is to use an emulator, tricking the program into thinking it’s using that same processor, which usually comes at the cost of speed.&nbsp;[†](#w-native)

Navigation
: The process of navigating a network of information resources in the World Wide Web, which is organized as hypertext or hypermedia. The user interface that is used to do so is called a web browser. A central theme in web design is the development of a web navigation interface that maximizes usability.&nbsp;[†](#w-navigation)

Nesting
: The organizing of information in layers, or the containing of objects in other objects. Nesting almost always refers to self-similar or recursive structures in some sense.&nbsp;[†](#w-nesting)

Net Promoter Score
: A management tool that can be used to gauge the loyalty of a firm’s customer relationships. It serves as an alternative to traditional customer satisfaction research and is claimed to be correlated with revenue growth. The Net Promoter Score is calculated based on responses to a single question: “How likely is it that you would recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague?”&nbsp;[†](#w-nps)

Netscape 4
: A version of Netscape Navigator memorable for web developers because of its particular support (or lack of support) of web standards.

Netscape Navigator
: A proprietary web browser, and the original browser of the Netscape line, from versions 1 to 4.08, and 9.x. It was the flagship product of the Netscape Communications Corp. and was the dominant web browser in terms of usage share in the 1990s. By 2002, use of Netscape Navigator had almost disappeared. Netscape Navigator was first released in 1994.&nbsp;[†](#w-netscape-navigator)

Network
: In computing, a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, computing devices exchange data with each other using connections (data links) between nodes. These data links are established over cable media such as twisted pair or fiber-optic cables, and wireless media such as Wi-Fi. Network computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called network nodes. Nodes are generally identified by network addresses, and can include hosts such as personal computers, phones, and servers, as well as networking hardware such as routers and switches. Computer networks support an enormous number of applications and services such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video, digital audio, shared use of application and storage servers, printers, and fax machines, and use of email and instant messaging applications as well as many others.&nbsp;[†](#w-network)

Newline
: A control character or sequence of control characters in a character encoding specification (e.g. ASCII or EBCDIC) that is used to signify the end of a line of text and the start of a new one. Some text editors set this special character when pressing the Enter key (“↵”).&nbsp;[†](#w-newline)

Nexus
: A framework for scaled product and software development based on Scrum. ℹ︎&nbsp;[scrum.org/resources/nexus-guide](https://www.scrum.org/resources/nexus-guide)
: → WorldWideWeb

NGINX
: A web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. NGINX was first released in 2004 by Igor Sysoev. As of August 2019, Netcraft estimated Nginx served 32% of all active websites ranked, ranking it first just above Apache at 29%.&nbsp;[†](#w-nginx) ℹ︎&nbsp;[nginx.com](https://www.nginx.com/)

Night Mode
: → Dark Mode

Node
: A basic unit of a data structure, such as a linked list or tree data structure. Nodes contain data and also may link to other nodes. Links between nodes are often implemented by pointers.&nbsp;[†](#w-node)
: → Node.js

Node.js
: An cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user’s web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.&nbsp;[†](#w-nodejs) ℹ︎&nbsp;[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

Non-Disclosure Agreement
: A legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. Doctor-patient confidentiality (physician-patient privilege), attorney-client privilege, priest-penitent privilege, bank-client confidentiality, and Kickback agreements are examples, often not enshrined in a written contract between the parties.&nbsp;[†](#w-nda)
