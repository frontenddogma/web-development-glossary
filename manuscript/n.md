# N

n-based indexing
: The option to freely choose the base index of an array. Usually programming languages allowing n-based indexing also allow negative index values and other scalar data types like enumerations, or characters may be used as an array index.&nbsp;[†](#w-array)

Namespace
: A namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organize objects of various kinds, so that these objects may be referred to by name. A namespace ensures that all the identifiers within it have unique names so that they can be easily identified. Prominent examples include file systems; programming languages that organize their variables and subroutines in namespaces; computer networks and distributed systems that assign names to resources, such as computers, printers, websites, (remote) files, etc.; and operating systems that partition kernel resources (process IDs, users, network sockets) by isolated namespaces to support virtualization containers.&nbsp;[†](#w-namespace)

NaN

Native
: Software or data formats that were designed to run on a particular system. In a more technical sense, native code is code written specifically for a certain processor. The only way to run this code on another processor is to use an emulator, tricking the program into thinking it's using that same processor, which usually comes at the cost of speed.&nbsp;[†](#w-native)

Newline
: A control character or sequence of control characters in a character encoding specification (e.g. ASCII or EBCDIC) that is used to signify the end of a line of text and the start of a new one. Some text editors set this special character when pressing the Enter key (“↵”).&nbsp;[†](#w-newline)

Node
: A basic unit of a data structure, such as a linked list or tree data structure. Nodes contain data and also may link to other nodes. Links between nodes are often implemented by pointers.&nbsp;[†](#w-node)

Node.js
: An cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user’s web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.&nbsp;[†](#w-nodejs) ℹ︎&nbsp;[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
