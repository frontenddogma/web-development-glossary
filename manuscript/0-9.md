8.3
: A filename convention used by old versions of DOS and versions of Microsoft Windows prior to Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows NT&nbsp;3.5. 8.3 is also used in modern Microsoft operating systems as an alternate filename to the long filename for compatibility with legacy programs. 8.3 filenames are limited to at most eight characters (after any directory specifier), followed optionally by a filename extension consisting of a period (“.”) and at most three further characters.&nbsp;[†](#w-83)
