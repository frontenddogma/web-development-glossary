Gamma
: A non-linear operation used to encode and decode luminance or tristimulus values in video or still image systems. Gamma encoding of images is used to optimize the usage of bits when encoding an image, or bandwidth used to transport an image, by taking advantage of the non-linear manner in which humans perceive light and color.&nbsp;[†](#w-gamma)

Garbage collection
: A form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector, or just collector, attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program. Garbage collection is essentially the opposite of manual memory management, which requires the programmer to specify which objects to deallocate and return to the memory system. However, many systems use a combination of approaches, including other techniques such as stack allocation and region inference.&nbsp;[†](#w-garbage-collection)

Gecko
: A browser engine developed by Mozilla. It is used in the Firefox browser, the Thunderbird email client, and many other projects. Gecko is designed to support open Internet standards, and is used by different applications to display web pages and, in some cases, an application’s user interface itself (by rendering XUL). Gecko offers a rich programming API that makes it suitable for a wide variety of roles in Internet-enabled applications, such as web browsers, content presentation, and client/server.&nbsp;[†](#w-gecko) ℹ︎&nbsp;[developer.mozilla.org/Mozilla/Gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/Mozilla/Gecko)

Git
: A distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. Git is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.&nbsp;[†](#w-git) ℹ︎&nbsp;[git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

GitHub
: A global company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. GitHub is a subsidiary of Microsoft, which acquired the company in 2018 for $7.5 billion. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.&nbsp;[†](#w-github) ℹ︎&nbsp;[github.com](https://github.com/)

GitLab
: A company providing a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that includes a Git-repository manager providing wiki, issue tracking, and CI/CD pipeline features. GitLab’s software was created by Ukrainians Dmitriy Zaporozhets and Valery Sizov in 2011.&nbsp;[†](#w-gitlab) ℹ︎&nbsp;[gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/)

Global
: → Global scope

Global object
: An object that always exists in the global scope. In JavaScript, there’s always a global object defined. In a web browser, when scripts create global variables, they’re created as members of the global object. (In Node.js this is not the case.) The global object’s interface depends on the execution context in which the script is running.&nbsp;[‡](#m-global-object)

Global scope
: The scope that contains, and is visible in, all other scopes. In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the code is being executed.&nbsp;[‡](#m-global-scope)

Global variable
: A variable that is declared in the global scope in other words, a variable that is visible from all other scopes. In JavaScript it is a property of the global object.&nbsp;[‡](#m-global-variable)

Glyph
: A readable mark of a particular meaning.

GNU General Public License
: A widely-used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. The license was originally written by Richard Stallman for the GNU Project, and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition. The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derivative work must be free software and distributed under the same or equivalent license terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely-used less-restrictive examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.&nbsp;[†](#w-gpl)

Goanna
: A browser engine that is a fork of Mozilla’s Gecko. It is used in the Pale Moon browser, the Basilisk browser, and other UXP-based applications. A fork of the K-Meleon browser also uses Goanna. Goanna as an independent fork of Gecko was first released in January 2016.&nbsp;[†](#w-goanna)

Graceful Degradation
: A design philosophy that centers around trying to build a modern web site/application that will work in the newest browsers, but fall back to an experience that while not as good still delivers essential content and functionality in older browsers. Polyfills can be used to build in missing features with JavaScript, but acceptable alternatives to features like styling and layout should be provided where possible, for example by using the CSS cascade, or HTML fallback behaviour.&nbsp;[‡](#m-graceful-degradation) 

Grapheme
: The smallest unit of a writing system of any given language. An individual grapheme may or may not carry meaning by itself, and may or may not correspond to a single phoneme of the spoken language. In other words, a grapheme is a letter or a number (set) of letters that represent a sound (more correctly, phoneme) in a word. Graphemes include alphabetic letters, typographic ligatures, Chinese characters, numerical digits, punctuation marks, and other individual symbols.&nbsp;[†](#w-grapheme)

Graphic

Graphical User Interface
: A form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs), which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard. The actions in a GUI are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements.&nbsp;[†](#w-gui)

Graphics Interchange Format
: A bitmap image format that was developed by a team at CompuServe, led by Steve Wilhite, in 1987. It has since come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web due to its wide support and portability between many applications and operating systems. The format supports up to 8 bits per pixel for each image, allowing a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256 different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It also supports animations and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make GIF less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with color gradients, but it is well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color.&nbsp;[†](#w-gif)

Graphics Processing Unit
: A specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing. Their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel.&nbsp;[†](#w-gpu)

Grid
: In design, a structure (usually two-dimensional) made up of a series of intersecting straight (vertical, horizontal, and angular) or curved lines (grid lines) used to structure content. The grid serves as an armature or framework on which a designer can organize graphic elements (images, glyphs, paragraphs, etc.) in a rational, easy-to-absorb manner. A grid can be used to organize graphic elements in relation to a page, in relation to other graphic elements on the page, or relation to other parts of the same graphic element or shape.&nbsp;[†](#w-grid)
: In CSS, an element defined using the `grid` value of the `display` property, for which columns and rows can be specified through the `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` properties. The grid defined this way is described as the explicit grid. If content is placed outside of this explicit grid, or if auto-placement and the grid algorithm is being relied on, then extra tracks will be created in the implicit grid. The implicit grid is the grid created automatically due to content being added outside of the tracks defined.&nbsp;[‡](#m-grid)

Grid track
: The space between two grid lines. They are defined in the explicit grid by using the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties or the shorthand `grid` or `grid-template` properties. Tracks are also created in the implicit grid by positioning a grid Item outside of the tracks created in the explicit grid.&nbsp;[‡](#m-grid-track)

Guetzli
: A JPEG encoder developed by Jyrki Alakujala, Robert Obryk, and Zoltán Szabadka, and released by Google in 2017. It specializes in high-end image quality where it is claimed to produce significantly smaller files than prior encoders at equivalent quality, albeit at very low speed. It is named after the Swiss German expression for Biscuits, in line with the names of other compression technology from Google.&nbsp;[†](#w-guetzli) ℹ︎&nbsp;[github.com/google/guetzli](https://github.com/google/guetzli)

Gutter
: The space between columns of printed text, including the gap between facing pages.&nbsp;[†](#w-gutter)

gzip
: A file format and software application used for file compression and decompression. The program was created by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler as a free software replacement for the compress program used in early Unix systems, and intended for use by GNU (the “g” is from “GNU”). Version 0.1 was released in October 1992, and version 1.0 in February 1993. gzip is based on the DEFLATE algorithm.&nbsp;[†](#w-gzip) ℹ︎&nbsp;[gnu.org/software/gzip](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/)
