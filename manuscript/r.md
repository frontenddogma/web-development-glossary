# R

Raku
: A member of the Perl family of programming languages. Formerly known as Perl&nbsp;6, it was renamed in 2019. Raku introduces elements of many modern and historical languages. Compatibility with Perl was not a goal, though a compatibility mode is part of the specification. The design process for Raku began in 2000.&nbsp;[†](#w-raku) ℹ︎&nbsp;[raku.org](https://www.raku.org/)

Random variable
: A variable whose values depend on outcomes of a random phenomenon. The formal mathematical treatment of random variables is a topic in probability theory. In that context, a random variable is understood as a measurable function defined on a probability space whose outcomes are typically real numbers.&nbsp;[†](#w-random-variable)

Ranking
:  relationship between a set of items such that, for any two items, the first is either “ranked higher than,” “ranked lower than” or “ranked equal to” the second. In mathematics, this is known as a weak order or total preorder of objects. It is not necessarily a total order of objects because two different objects can have the same ranking. The rankings themselves are totally ordered. Search engines rank web pages by their expected relevance to a user’s query using a combination of query-dependent and query-independent methods. Query-independent methods attempt to measure the estimated importance of a page, independent of any consideration of how well it matches the specific query. Query-independent ranking is usually based on link analysis; examples include the HITS algorithm, PageRank and TrustRank.&nbsp;[†](#w-ranking)

Raster image
: A dot matrix data structure that represents a generally rectangular grid of pixels (points of color), viewable via a monitor, paper, or other display medium. Raster images are stored in image files with varying formats. A raster is technically characterized by the width and height of the image in pixels and by the number of bits per pixel (or color depth, which determines the number of colors it can represent). Most computer images are stored in raster graphics formats or compressed variations, including GIF, JPEG, and PNG.&nbsp;[†](#w-raster-image)

RDF
: → Resource Description Framework

RDF Site Summary
: A web feed which allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. These feeds can, for example, allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator. The news aggregator will automatically check the RSS feed for new content, allowing the list to be automatically passed from website to website or from website to user. Websites usually use RSS feeds to publish frequently updated information, such as blog entries, news headlines, or episodes of audio and video series. RSS is also used to distribute podcasts. An RSS document (called “feed,” “web feed,” or “channel”) includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author’s name.&nbsp;[†](#w-rss)

React
: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React was first released in 2013 and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.&nbsp;[†](#w-react) ℹ︎&nbsp;[reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)

ReactJS

Reactive Extensions for JavaScript
: A library for the development of asynchronous and event-based programs, with helpers for asynchronous or callback-based code. ℹ︎&nbsp;[reactivex.io](http://reactivex.io/)

Reactive Programming
: A declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. With this paradigm it is possible to express static (e.g., arrays) or dynamic (e.g., event emitters) data streams with ease, and also communicate that an inferred dependency within the associated execution model exists, which facilitates the automatic propagation of the changed data flow. Reactive programming has been proposed as a way to simplify the creation of interactive user interfaces and near-real-time system animation.&nbsp;[†](#w-reactive-programming)

Read the Fucking Manual
: The suggesting that one could have found more information or a solution to a problem in documentation. Initialisms similar to RTFM include “STFW” (“Search the Fucking Web”), “GIYF” (“Google Is Your Friend”), “DYOR” (“Do Your Own Research”), and “LMGTFY” (“Let Me Google That for You”).&nbsp;[†](#w-rtfm)

Read-Eval-Print Loop
: A simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e., single expressions), evaluates (executes) them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise. The term is usually used to refer to programming interfaces similar to the classic Lisp machine interactive environment. Common examples include command line shells and similar environments for programming languages, and the technique is very characteristic of scripting languages.&nbsp;[†](#w-repl)

README
: A file that contains information about other files in a directory or archive of computer software. A form of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file called READ.ME, README.TXT, README.md (for a text file using markdown markup), README.1ST, or simply README. The file's name is generally written in uppercase letters.&nbsp;[†](#w-readme)

Real User Monitoring
: a passive monitoring technology that records all user interaction with a website or client interacting with a server or cloud-based application. Monitoring actual user interaction with a website or an application is important to operators to determine if users are being served quickly and without errors and, if not, which part of a business process is failing. Real user monitoring data is used to determine the actual service-level quality delivered to end-users and to detect errors or slowdowns on web sites.&nbsp;[†](#w-rum)

Recidivism
: As an Agile metric, the total number of user stories completed in a sprint that entered development for the second time divided by the total number of completed stories.

Recursion
: A method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Such problems can generally be solved by iteration, but this needs to identify and index the smaller instances at programming time. At the opposite, recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science.&nbsp;[†](#w-recursion)

Red, Green, and Blue
: As the RGB color model, an additive color model in which red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography. RGB is a device-dependent color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time. Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management.&nbsp;[†](#w-rgb)
