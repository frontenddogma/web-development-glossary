Anonymous function
: A function definition that is not bound to an identifier. Anonymous functions are often arguments being passed to higher-order functions, or used for constructing the result of a higher-order function that needs to return a function. If the function is only used once, or a limited number of times, an anonymous function may be syntactically lighter than using a named function. Anonymous functions are ubiquitous in functional programming languages and other languages with first-class functions.&nbsp;[†](#w-anonymous-function)

An applet is not a full-featured application program but intended to be easily accessible.&nbsp;[†](#w-applet)

Application
: A computer program designed to help people perform an activity. An application differs from an operating system (which runs a computer), a utility (which performs maintenance or general-purpose chores), and a programming tool (with which computer programs are created). Depending on the activity for which it was designed, an application can manipulate text, numbers, audio, graphics, and a combination of these elements. Some application packages focus on a single task, such as word processing; others, called integrated software include several applications.&nbsp;[†](#w-application)

Application Programming Interface
: An interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software. An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library.&nbsp;[†](#w-api)

: A data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.&nbsp;[†](#w-array)

It was first released in 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework, and is the successor to Microsoft’s Active Server Pages (ASP) technology.&nbsp;[†](#w-aspnet) ℹ︎&nbsp;[dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet)

Aspect ratio
: A proportional relationship between an image’s width and height. The aspect ratio is commonly expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, as in 16:9.&nbsp;[†](#w-aspect-ratio)

Assignment
: The setting or resetting of the value stored in the storage location(s) denoted by a variable name; in other words, an assignment statement copies a value into the variable. In most imperative programming languages, the assignment statement (or expression) is a fundamental construct. Today, the most commonly used notation for this basic operation has come to be `x = expr` (originally Superplan 1949–51, popularized by Fortran 1957 and C) followed by `x := expr` (originally ALGOL 1958, popularised by Pascal), although there are many other notations in use.&nbsp;[†](#w-assignment)

Association for Computing Machinery
: An international learned society for computing. The ACM was founded in 1947, and is the world’s largest scientific and educational computing society. The ACM is a non-profit professional membership group, reporting nearly 100,000 student and professional members as of 2019. Its headquarters are in New York City. The ACM is an umbrella organization for academic and scholarly interests in computer science. Its motto is “Advancing Computing as a Science and Profession.”&nbsp;[†](#w-acm) ℹ︎&nbsp;[acm.org](https://www.acm.org/)

Asynchronous
: The occurrence of events independent of the main program flow. A common way for dealing with asynchrony in is to provide subroutines that return to their caller an object, sometimes called a future or promise, that represents the ongoing events.&nbsp;[†](#w-asynchronous)

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
: A set of web development techniques using web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and applications to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize JSON instead of XML.&nbsp;[†](#w-ajax)

at

Attribute
: A property of an object, element, or file. An attribute may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance. An attribute of an object usually consists of a name and a value; of an element, a type or class name; of a file, a name and extension. Attributes should be considered meta data.&nbsp;[†](#w-attribute)

Attribute minimization
: The valid option for a Boolean attribute not to have a value if it’s set (and therefore true). In XML-based languages, attribute minimization is disallowed and attributes must have a value; that is, `checked` would be required to be written `checked="checked"`.

Augmented Reality
: An interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory. AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects.&nbsp;[†](#w-ar)

Authentication
: The act of proving an assertion, such as the identity of a computer system user. In contrast with identification, the act of indicating a person or thing’s identity, authentication is the process of verifying that identity.&nbsp;[†](#w-authentication)

Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
: Guidelines for designing web content authoring tools that are accessible to authors with disabilities and designed to enable, support, and promote the production of more accessible web content by all authors. ℹ︎&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/ATAG20](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/)

Authorization
: The specifying of access rights and privileges to resources, which is related to information security and computer security in general and to access control in particular. More formally, “to authorize” is to define an access policy.&nbsp;[†](#w-authorization)

Automagic
: A blend of “automatic” and “magic,” referring to an action that’s performed automatically but also in a way as to seem magical.

Automatic Semicolon Insertion
: A ECMAScript feature in which a semicolon is automatically inserted when two statements are separated by a line ending or a closing brace (`}`), or if a line ending follows either of `break`, `continue`, `return`, or `throw` (restricted production).

Automation
: A technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimal human assistance. Automation or automatic control is the use of various control systems for operating equipment.&nbsp;[†](#w-automation)
