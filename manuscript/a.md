In software testing the ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board) defines acceptance testing as formal testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business processes conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria and to enable users, customers, or other authorized entities to determine whether to accept the system. Acceptance testing is also known as user acceptance testing (UAT), end user testing, operational acceptance testing (OAT), acceptance test-driven development (ATDD), or field (acceptance) testing. Acceptance criteria are the criteria that a system or component must satisfy in order to be accepted by a user, customer, or other authorized entity.&nbsp;[†](#w-acceptance-testing)

Aliasing
: An effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when sampled. Aliasing also often refers to the distortion or artifact that results when a signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal. Aliasing can occur in signals sampled in time, for instance digital audio, and is referred to as temporal aliasing. It can also occur in spatially sampled signals (e.g., moiré patterns in digital images); this type of aliasing is called spatial aliasing.

Asynchronous Module Definition
: A specification for the JavaScript programming language. AMD defines an API that defines code modules and their dependencies, and loads them asynchronously if desired. Implementations of AMD promise website performance improvements, because AMD implementations load smaller JavaScript files, and then only when they are needed. AMD implementations also suggest fewer page errors, because developers can define dependencies that must load before a module is executed, so the module does not try to use outside code that is not available yet.&nbsp;[†](#w-amd) ℹ︎&nbsp;[github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api)

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
: A set of web development techniques using web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, AJAX allows web pages and applications to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize JSON instead of XML.&nbsp;[†](#w-ajax)

The acronym was coined in 1983 by Andreas Reuter and Theo Härder.&nbsp;[†](#w-acid)

Attributes should be considered metadata.&nbsp;[†](#w-attribute)

Attribute minimization

Augmented Reality
: An interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory.
