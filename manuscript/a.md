Asynchronous Module Definition
: A specification for the JavaScript programming language. AMD defines an API that defines code modules and their dependencies, and loads them asynchronously if desired. Implementations of AMD promise website performance improvements, because AMD implementations load smaller JavaScript files, and then only when they are needed. AMD implementations also suggest fewer page errors, because developers can define dependencies that must load before a module is executed, so the module does not try to use outside code that is not available yet. [†](#w-amd) ℹ︎ [github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api)

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

The acronym was coined in 1983 by Andreas Reuter and Theo Härder. [†](#w-acid)

Attribute
: A property of an object, element, or file. An attribute may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance. An attribute of an object usually consists of a name and a value; of an element, a type or class name; of a file, a name and extension. Attributes should be considered metadata. [†](#w-attribute)

Attribute minimization
