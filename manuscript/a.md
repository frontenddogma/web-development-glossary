Abstract Data Type
: A mathematical model for data types, where a data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-adt)

Anonymous block box
: Within a block container box, a block-level box forced by the presence of other block-level boxes. In `<div>Some text<p>More text</div>`, ‚ÄúSome text‚Äù resides in an anonymous block-level box because `<p>` spawned a block-level box.

Anonymous block element
: ‚Üí Anonymous block box

Anonymous inline box
: Inline boxes that do not have an associated inline-level element.

Anonymous inline element
: Any text that is directly contained inside a block container element that‚Äôs not inside an inline element.

ANSI
: ‚Üí American National Standards Institute

AOM

Apache
: ‚Üí Apache HTTP Server

Apache HTTP Server
: A free and open-source cross-platform web server. The Apache server was first released in 1995. üåç&nbsp;[httpd.apache.org](https://httpd.apache.org/)

API
: ‚Üí Application Programming Interface

App
: ‚Üí Application

Applet
: Any small application that performs a specific task that runs within the scope of a dedicated widget engine or a larger program, often as a plug-in. Usually referring to a Java applet, a program written in the Java programming language that is designed to be placed on a web page. An applet is not a full-featured application program but intended to be easily accessible.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-applet)

Application
: A computer program designed to help people perform an activity. An application differs from an operating system (which runs a computer), a utility (which performs maintenance or general-purpose chores), and a programming tool (with which computer programs are created). Depending on the activity for which it was designed, an application can manipulate text, numbers, audio, graphics, and a combination of these elements. Some application packages focus on a single task, such as word processing; others, called integrated software include several applications.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-application)

Application Programming Interface
: An interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software. An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-api)

Argument
: The actual input expression passed or supplied to a function, procedure, or routine in a call or invocation statement.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-parameter-argument)

ARIA
: ‚Üí Accessible Rich Internet Applications

Array
: A data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-array)

ASCII
: ‚Üí American Standard Code for Information Interchange

ASI
: ‚Üí Automatic Semicolon Insertion

ASP

Aspect ratio
: A proportional relationship between an image‚Äôs width and height. The aspect ratio is commonly expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, as in 16:9.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-aspect-ratio)

Assistive technology
: Assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices and software for people with disabilities or the elderly population. Assistive technology can ameliorate the effects of disabilities that limit the ability to perform activities of daily living.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-at)  

Asynchronous
: The occurrence of events independent of the main program flow. A common way for dealing with asynchrony in is to provide subroutines that return to their caller an object, sometimes called a future or promise, that represents the ongoing events.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-asynchronous)

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
: A set of web development techniques using web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and applications to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize JSON instead of XML.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-ajax)

AT
: ‚Üí Assistive technology

ATAG
: ‚Üí Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines

Atom
: An XML-based feed format consisting of two web standards, the Atom Syndication Format and the Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub or APP).

Attribute
: A property of an object, element, or file. An attribute may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance. An attribute of an object usually consists of a name and a value; of an element, a type or class name; of a file, a name and extension. Attributes should be considered meta data.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-attribute)

Authentication
: The act of proving an assertion, such as the identity of a computer system user. In contrast with identification, the act of indicating a person or thing's identity, authentication is the process of verifying that identity.&nbsp;[‚Ä†](#w-authentication)

Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
: Guidelines for designing web content authoring tools that are accessible to authors with disabilities and designed to enable, support, and promote the production of more accessible web content by all authors. üåç&nbsp;[w3.org/TR/ATAG20](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/)

Authorization
: The specifying of access rights or privileges to resources, and defining an access policy.

Automagic
: A blend of ‚Äúautomatic‚Äù and ‚Äúmagic,‚Äù referring to an action that‚Äôs performed automatically but in such a way as to seem magical.

Automatic Semicolon Insertion
: A ECMAScript feature in which a semicolon is automatically inserted when two statements are separated by a line ending or a closing brace (`}`), or if a line ending follows either of `break`, `continue`, `return`, or `throw` (restricted production).

Automation
: A technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimal to no human assistance.
