.gitignore
: A plain-text file that, one per line, contains patterns for files and directories to be ignored by Git version control.

.htaccess
: A directory-level configuration file supported by several web servers, used for the configuration of website access issues, such as URL redirection, URL shortening, access control, and more. A site could have more than one .htaccess file, and the files are placed inside the web tree (i.e., inside directories and their subdirectories). .htaccess files act as a subset of the server’s global configuration file (like httpd.conf) for the directory that they are in, or all subdirectories. The original purpose of .htaccess—reflected in its name—was to allow per-directory access control by, for example, requiring a password to access web content. More commonly, however, the .htaccess files define or override many other configuration settings such as content type, character set, CGI handlers, etc.&nbsp;[†](#w-htaccess)

.htpasswd
: A flat file used to store usernames and password for basic authentication on an Apache HTTP Server. The name of the file is given in the .htaccess configuration, and can be anything although “.htpasswd” is the canonical name. .htpasswd is often maintained with the shell command “htpasswd” which can add, delete, and update users, and will properly encode the password for use (so that it is easily checked, but not reversed back to the original password). The file consists of rows, each row corresponding to a username, followed by a colon, followed by a string containing the hashed password optionally prepended by an algorithm specifier (`$2y$`, `$apr1$`, or `{SHA}`) or salt. The hash historically used “Unix crypt” style with MD5 or SHA1 as common alternatives, although as of version 2.2.18 a variant of MD5 is now the default.&nbsp;[†](#w-htpasswd)

.NET
: → .NET Framework

.NET Framework
: A software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. The .NET Framework includes a large class library named as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for the .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using the .NET Framework is called managed code. FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework. .NET was first released in 2002.&nbsp;[†](#w-net) ℹ︎&nbsp;[dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)

: An indicator for a declaration that, by virtue of the CSS cascade, is to take precedence over a normal declaration.
